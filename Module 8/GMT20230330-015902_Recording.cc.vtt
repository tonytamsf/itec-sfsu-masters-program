WEBVTT

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And probably talking about the game play itself. That'll be the most most of what we do.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So basically we're we're gonna discuss this kind of in context of game plan.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
What better way to do that than to share again that many none of you, I'm sure, have played.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's not the kind of game you would. You would normally be looking to play like with your friends, or even your students.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Maybe, but I do I think it's a good good game for us to play, anyway.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But before we get into that let's take a quick look at the discussion from last week before we jump into that to today's topic.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I'm gonna share my screen and.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Well, also open this up. And, Adam, I know you had something else you wanted to bring into the conversation.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So we'll make the moment space for that as well.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And and you know it kind of at any point.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So in session 7. I don't know most of you, I think, have gone been able to participate already.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I went through, and I've you know, been kind of adding comments to each of the each of the each of the threads here.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So anyone wanna pull out any of these comments or the things that you were talking about to to highlight?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
There's quite a few here.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You know a lot lot of talk about, you know.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Various types of Xr. Or you know any letter in front of ours.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Immersive or reality, but also just augmented reality, a virtual reality and just to reiterate this stuff's been around for quite a long time.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:04.000
It. It hasn't hasn't percolated so much into the mainstream of education I think a lot because of the 2 things.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Really, the technology that's required to use it at a highly immersive level, but also creating the experiences, typically still takes a substantial amount of design and effort for those immersive experiences there are other things we can use like immersive video 3 60 video things like that that can actually build a more

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
engaging experience, for students who are watching those that are simple to create these days.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
You just have to have a $400 camera to do so.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But that's not really what we were talking about.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:43.000
What we were talking about this.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Okay. No. Interest. Alright. Okay. Well.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Go ahead, Adam!

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Oh, I was just gonna say, I I this discussion has gotten me more.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Open to extended reality. Invitements. I think I've just seen so many limitations to them in my work.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Based on cost. It's like, yeah, the 2 things you said like the cost, the access to them.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And then the time, investment, resources investment, which is also cost to design something that can actually be used for learning.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But this conversation definitely got me more opened to the idiot.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I think, Dlton even mentioned, like your prediction that, like the cost, will go down, and there might be more like open source or other types of accessible pieces of software that, too, then design to for to enable an instructional designer or a teacher to design something which is which

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
got me more open to this, because it's kind of been off my radar because I just haven't.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
I haven't been in a position to ever really consider extended reality.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:26.000
1 one of the the things I posted earlier today is this article from 2022 that talks about creating an immersive learning experience for students by educators, and it talks about the kind of what it takes to do.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
This, you know the design, aspects. What? What do you have to plan out?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:37.000
What are some of the tools you might want to use? And if you read through this, it seems to be something that's it's I think it's.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I think it's something that teachers could do if they were really interested in doing it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It is not. It's not easy. The path that they're talking about is not a simple pattern, but it is something that you know, technology savvy teachers with some access to some of some resources, especially time, could probably do this if you're interested in learning, a little bit.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.000
More about that. It's you can, you know, it's a free online.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Hmm!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Pdf, you can least scan through it and look at some of the things that they're talking about.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Some of the platforms and things like that.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Yeah. The one thing that I'm most noticing that is growing are places where you can go to do.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
VR right? I mean, that's the have buying the headset and all that stuff.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
It all software can be pretty expensive, but I see a lot of people using them for gaming.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And this is, I'm posting a list of some spots and services, but I haven't been anywhere in San Francisco yet, but I've done some of these in other places.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Couple of times, and they're pretty fun, and also they can have better equipment there as well, and sort of like accessories to kind of go with it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And I I could see it sort of going that way, too, where, instead of like everybody having their own thing, it's kind of shared right like sort of like a lift or Uber model type thing.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Yeah. There's a what's the company that's doing this kind of on the entertainment side.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Is it dreamscape, or something like that, anyway?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There's no cause. Sandbox.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Black box, game, day.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yeah, sandbox.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
There's the yeah. There's one that I know they have.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
They've had. They've had like spaces and like malls and things like that.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I don't know how many there may respond. Not that many, because they're pretty.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
They're pretty costly to build and you can't charge people couple $100 an hour to use them right? Because who would do that?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.000
They worked with Asu on the biology experience. I don't know.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I think I think I mentioned that at some point.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Maybe somewhere. But that was a special special situation, but but their business model essentially is to build these.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It, you know, these experiences that are based more on entertainment in places where people gather and let them come in kinda like, you know, like a laser tag.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Remember those days, or those kinds of things. That's the that's the kind of model that there seem to be trying to do with that.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And and then part of our other model is to have other people buy their services, to build them out for their specific uses.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Yeah.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Yeah, I see your dreamscape.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Yup!

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Dreamscape. Yeah, yeah. But there are other ways.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
You can do simple things, even with, you know, you can do things with Xr.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000
With just smartphones. Alright, it's they're limited, of course, but you could, if you know creative thinking, you know, teachers with creative thinking, you know, have make make the world go around in many ways.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You can do simple things, and they can still be engaging for students.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So even though, yeah, the deep and deeply immersive environments cost a lot to build, deploy, and take some substantial technology to make them work, you can still do simple things, and it can still be really engaging for students, especially if they're used to not you know, nothing like this a lot of

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000
virtual tour right? If you've if you've done those with a class of students there for some I'm students that may be the closest they ever get to seen a place like that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And for many of them it can be quite engaging, especially if it got something meaningful to do while they're kind of walking around a space, or even just using their arrows to, you know, to go around there.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Are there a couple of places? But there were a bunch of links that were put into the discussion form.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We're on that.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Okay. So, Adam Adam, you once you you wanna bring in your your extra top.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Yeah, well, I'm just interested, like I. So I know.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And I guess, is, is it really just in 2 weeks, potentially, that we have, we're presenting on our next?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Potentially in 2 weeks. Yeah, potentially, yeah.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yeah, hey? Emergency? Yeah. On emerge on engagement technology.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Right? Engagement. Okay?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And so I think I'm just, I guess in I find that in I do see that, like all of these areas, do overlap of assessment, instruction and engagement, they all overlap in some way.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But when it comes to engagement I see it as like a pretty broad topic, and maybe that's intentional.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:06.000
But, like I'm assuming you don't just meet like VR games and I think coding is the other topic we're exploring.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But like engagement, can be much more broadly defined.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Yeah, okay.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
For the purposes of this project, even like cause, even in like in my work, student engagement, even encompasses like admissions and stuff like that.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Admissions.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000
So like, where does it? Of just like that's engaging a student to come to the school?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So just like, where does engagement start in the context of education, technology?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And where does it end?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Yeah. Well, a bunch of institutions are basically creating immersive tours.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Right and using that as part of the admissions, or there are, you know, the process to bring a student in, to get them interested in the campus, but also then to once they've kind of signed some intention to be there to auto to push this stuff out and yeah come and see

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
what it's like, and you can't be here in person.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Right.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:16.000
That's fine. You can do this immersive tour, and they'll there's even a there's a company that has a platform that essentially allows the student to do join a tour or to join a do a virtual tour but also then talk to someone who's like on call to take a call

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
from a student online chatting, or maybe even a phone call.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
About this, the campus, and especially specific things on campus.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I forget the company that was trying they were trying to sell that service to us, but as a way of making that more meaningful, more engaging, using technology to do things that they couldn't do because they weren't.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
They weren't regionally located, or just, you know, the time he didn't work, or whatever it was.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So, yeah, I think I what we're looking for are the uses of technologies, newer technologies, or even older technologies and new ways, emerging as you would to find emerging for your situation that are focused on engaging learners in some particular way it could be students

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
in school, but it also could be trainees, like in a workspace, or things like that.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
I don't wanna make it just school focused.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
That's what majority of us are probably thinking about.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:13.000
But engagement right? You know there are a lot of things we did with content that we're engaging ways of interacting with content.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
But the I wouldn't wanna focus on that that we've kind of.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We kind of done. And some people we're talking about accessing content in a very engaging industry in ways, even though engagement wasn't the focus of that.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Right.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Okay.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So in some ways it's kinda like how we make the case for engagement.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Within what we're saying, yeah.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Alright. Yeah, exactly. Certainly.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay, meaning it could be, it doesn't necessarily have to be games or VR or, okay.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
No, doesn't that have to necessarily be games?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Gotcha great.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:55.000
No, no, but I bet a bunch of people will pick something like one of these areas.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Hopefully, hopefully, hopefully, your find some interest in it.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:11.000
There's so many resources to us. If you look at the additional resources that are posted for this week, there's some really cool stuff to play with in as one of the sites in particular, forget exactly.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I think it might be the third. I don't know if there's 3 there, it's probably the third one.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I had to fix a link to make it work again, but and so so hopefully, that'll be interesting to you.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:34.000
The any other comments on the discussion.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Alright. Well, let me jump over, then let's take a quick look.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Let me. Let's take a look at the kind of the plan for this week.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I hope you found that to be way too much to expect you to read.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Did you find it to be way too much? I hope it's like a 100 pages right?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:55.000
But I you know as as I got the book from I know Kurt Square, and so I got the book from the library, and I was just going through.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I said, well, can't just stop a chapter one. There's so much there, and so we'll have a chapter 2.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Oh, yeah. Then, look at chapter 20, yeah. Then look at chapter 3.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
It's talking about how to use this with students in the class, how to kind of arrange this.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Yeah. And then there was some really other cool things I wanted to bring in later.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So I probably brought in a little more than a book than I should have, but the intention is not for you to read all of that.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The intention is for you to kind of scan it hopefully.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Reading the first chapter, at least kind of all the way through, and then looking.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Starting to scan for things that were most interesting to you.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
That's and that's typically the way it I've been doing this, even though I mean, that's specifically say that that is generally my intention.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And the way the class is kind of designed. You pick this up if if you're not able to do all the readings, it, it doesn't really stop you from participating effectively in the class, although if you do more of the reads, you can bring in more of the ideas from the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
readings into your discussion posts and our discussions in class and things like that.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So, but I also know that that's a Pdf you can download and you can go back and refer to that later.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:09.000
When you have more time to look through it, and something that seems to be more interesting for you, or specifically interesting for you.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So anyway, that's that's that is what it is.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Okay. So there was a reading. And there was a video. We could talk more about that a little bit later before we get into any of that, I think what we wanna do, what I'd like to do is is engage you in playing a game.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Alright, so to do this, we're going to use a game that was created and created by people actually in the instrumental design and technology field.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And so Indiana University, where I got my Phd.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Had built this game a long time ago. It started actually as a board game, and the idea was to help students, students who are learning about.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Generally speaking, the world of human performance, technology wanted to work in organizations or work, as you know, teachers or technology specialists and part of the job has always been to help implementation move through an organization, how people change their minds about adopting things deciding to do things

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
differently, because oftentimes what we're in the business of doing in this world, at least as an instructional designer is helping create change.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You become an 8 a change in an agent, a change agent, and every teacher is a change agent as well off with their own students, but also some, you know, teachers also start acting more as change agents in their school.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:41.000
In their organization, even in their district, right? Because they see we could do this better.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Or here's a really wonderful way of doing this. How do I help people understand how to do this better?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Or the instit institution may do this and say, Okay, we want, we're all gonna change over to this new kind of curriculum password.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
A different way of teaching this to these grade levels.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:08.000
But they often don't do that very well, as far as helping people adopt the change in more of a natural pattern and so this game is to help you kinda understand.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So of those principles and it works best. If you know a little bit about diffusion of innovations, theory.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And so there's the summary guide. That's the Pdf.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
That's linked here in the on the agenda page.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
But it's also it's also linked actually from the game itself.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:38.000
And this is a simple thing to scan. It's simply 7 pages long, and it talks about some of the principles that you will want to it's simply 7 pages long, and it talks about some of the principles that you will want to apply now because as you may have

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
read in squires reading that good games are built on us, you know, to reveal systems right?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And so there's there's a system.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:55.000
There's a systemic approach to how to create change in an organization, especially a social organization, which means that people talk to each other, and they make decisions based on their interactions and relationships with other people.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And so that becomes a really important thing to take advantage of, or to kind of leverage all in a good way.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:09.000
In our case to help people make some decisions, to do things differently.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And so what helps innovation spread right? Their relative advantage, their compatibility with what we're doing already.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And our values. How simple are they! How easy to use! Can I try it and go back if I don't like it?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Can I see results right away? Those are some principles, these 5 qualities of a change that help help make it more adoptable.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And then the talks about the importance of peer to peer conversations and peer networks, understanding who talks to?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Who and what's their relationship? What are the power relationships for?

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:52.000
You know that you would want to know about, so that you don't try to come in and convince someone who has absolutely no power in their network, it's been a lot of time and energy convincing that person to adopt it.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
And no one listens to that person, for whatever reason, right?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So those are some other principles, so I hope you you can scan through this pretty quickly.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
You can download. It's linked in a couple of places different.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:10.000
You are probably familiar with this graph. You may have seen this before. You may have seen it.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
One of my classes. I'm not sure, anyway.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So we're gonna try to implement, use some of these principles to play this game.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000
And so the game, the basically the way the game is going to work is, there's a link here.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
It's a online game. Now, it's not a board game anymore.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:38.000
And the online game works you're gonna work in it in a group of 2 or 3 people and at least one of you will have to create a login for this.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And you just need an email, an active email address and a password.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
They will. They will never market anything to you if they have nothing.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:22:01.000
To market to you. They just wanna make sure that you have a chance to actually come back into the game later and pick up on an old game. If you don't have a chance to finish it any apps. And you do, you can all you can all sign up for this if you want to but at least one of your will work

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:08.000
for you will do this. And the idea is you're making decisions as as a small team here, right?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And your the challenge is to bring an adoption of a new curriculum.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I think it's a new math curriculum into a school, and you know some of you may actually work in in situations where this is part of what you need to be able to do as a job.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
If you haven't registered yet, you can register you just give them an email address and a password.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And it verifies your email. And then you just you validate your email.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
And then you're ready to go when you when you do get into that, I'll show you how it's starts and what it looks like right here.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I do have an account I have to refresh it. I think they I think they kind of roll out all the old passwords after every couple of weeks, so that an old password doesn't stick around, and that's probably a good security thing for them, others you don't putting data in

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
here but it's probably good practice. Oh, no, maybe have to change this.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Let's try again. Might have had my own password in there.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:11.000
That's too long.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
So they're not really grabbing any data other than your.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
You're on. You know your email and your what? I guess they keep your password so you can log in.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
You can come back. I'm gonna start a new game.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000
So you see what it looks like when you hit enter, and then do I want it?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Yeah, I do. Thank you for we're checking. And so this is the game board.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:39.000
All right, and what what I'd like you to do while you're playing the game is to be taking some notes about what you're noticing.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
In our breakout notes, Page. And so if you go to the breakout notes, page, I'm gonna step up.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Aside from this for us in session 8. There's 2 things I'd like you to take some notes on and we're just gonna do this as a group.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:59.000
So it's not each individual group. I want you to under. Take a look at in this area.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Talk about what you found to be successful in playing this game.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Basically, how does the game play work? Well, what did you have to do to make some success?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:19.000
And there's going to be a there's going to be a path of success that that you will all find some more than others so that's one thing about the game play.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
And then the second part is, well, okay, what about the game?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Yeah, what do you see in the game design the way it's played?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Maybe some of the rules, maybe the systems that it's showing you those kinds of things, the possibility is that engages is not engaging anyways, but basically tying it back to the principles that you found in scanning at least the first chapter of the Squire read okay, and if you wanna if you're

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:57.000
gonna add notes to this, and if you're not ready for a notes on this one, that might be something to do after class for those of you who are watching the recording, I won't expect you to play the game as well, and to add your own notes to this page Alright and so we should when when

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
you add a chunk of notes, put a label on it, so I know who's doing it, so I can give people attribution for that.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Alright. So back to the game. So here's basically, here's the challenge is is, where do we find?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:20.000
We? Let's see, how about we should look at the game rules the game rules is the first screen that I would want to look at.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
And here's the objective you're gonna be a change agent right?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Lot of instructional designers end up in this kind of a role we're gonna persuade as many of the staff members as possible adopt a particular innovation.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Oh, pure tutoring. And so we're gonna bring in a peer tutoring emphasis in the next oh, I don't know. Let's say the next year. So this is going to be the thing we're trying to do and how do we do it.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Better. And so we're let's say, here's your role.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
So it gives you a role. You're a reading specialist, and you've assigned to conduct a federally funded project at some high school.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:07.000
These people were all in Bloomington, Indiana, when they wrote this, and so they probably have a school in mind so it's gonna look like, you know, kinda like your resources.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:13.000
You have time. Okay, you get 2 years to achieve this. And so you basically get 72 weeks because the schools don't work for the whole year.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.000
And so there's above 36 working weeks in a school year.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
So every what you're going to do is you're going to be asked to make some decisions about approaches.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
You want to take. I I wanna talk to this person.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I want to provide a presentation to this group. I want to, you know. Go, you know.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Do see if I can get a reference for someone. I said, right, but all these things are gonna take you as soon as I get a reference for someone I said right. But all these things are gonna take you a certain amount of time.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Some take very short amount of time like one week. Some might take 3 or 4 okay, and the game ends when you've used up all your time, or you've achieved a 100% adoption across the school.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Everybody wants to do peer tutoring. So this is a couple of things you can do about you about getting a dapters.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
So you probably need some information about the people before you start figuring out well, who do I talk to first?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000
How do I talk to a particular one? Is this pretty someone who's going to be a you know?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Maybe a early adopter, and could be part of an initial piloting team.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Or is this person likely to be someone who's not interested until they have to do it?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
You know more on the language side of its scale, and so gather information that's a a good starting point.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Talk to people. All right, then you have different activities, and there's 13 different ones.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
We can take a look at that on the board, and then you end up with you.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Get influenced points and you get adoption. Influence points are how much influence you have with a particular player or role.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And when you get to, when you some require more influence, points to do an adoption, some take very little, and there are some actions that actually get you a whole block of people, you know, based on their word.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So you can read about the, of course, read through that the rules, and then we're going to pay, play the game, and then you have the game log, which I believe is what you what you try to do to do.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:16.000
So this is like the record keeping so you don't have to remember who you talked to, or what activity you did and what the feedback was.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
It'll keep a record of that for you so to play the game.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
The one of the things that I, you know, is important to do, I think, is to find out.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Get some information, and so what you would do then is that you?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Let's see. Alright! How do I remember?

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000
How do I do this? So I want to get some. I want some information.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:48.000
And so I clicked on the personal information list. And now who do I want information and I can gather 5 at least 5 people I don't know who to go for, but maybe it's important to get some information about.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Oh! The principal! The secretary, and maybe some of that.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Maybe the chair. Sometimes those are important. People, sometimes they're not.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
There are probably some other teachers that would be real important sometimes, the, you know, like the library could be really important, too.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
So that's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna get I'm gonna get information for them.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
I'm getting information and then it gets some results.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So now, what's happening over on the left here is that I'm getting more information about these people.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
So now I can start to say, Okay, now, I can do some other things.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I've already got some information, so now I can look for. Well, who who do they?

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Who do they share lunch with? Who do they serve on committees left with?

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Who do they have some sort of social interaction with it that somehow I would know about.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Or do I wanna talk to them? Do I ask them for help?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Want a pilot with them already, might wanna wait a little bit for that.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
You could do all these other kinds of things, you know.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Do local mass media output, etc., and you pick something else to do.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:56.000
So let's say, for example. Well, how? What if I start by talking to somebody now who do I want to talk to now?

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I can only pick them. One person to talk to a once.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:09.000
So hmm! Maybe peer tutoring. What's a good area for peer tutoring?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Especially someone who might know a little bit about already. Well, I'm I'm gonna go with.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:14.000
I'm gonna go with the math chair and see what happens so I'm going to down a submit and let's see what happens.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:30.000
There. So now, what I get from that is, I get this person, apparently oh, they don't like the fads, and they think it's maybe a and but it gives me some information.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:37.000
If a principle or a math teacher or science teacher, or a language, arts, chairman is in the trial.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Phaser has adopted. Then I could add, I don't get 2 more points because they weren't in the trial phase yet, so I was just looking for Aness.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And so what? That? So what shows up here for the math chairperson?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Is that I can continue and then it will update the scorecard.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Now I can see this little red mark here. That's an influence piece. And so I have.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
I have a bunch more to get with this person before I get them into the adoption phase.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
The only people who have to adopt are the ones who are.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I think they're the well. There's teachers in Gangs cultures. For some reason the secretary doesn't have to adopt.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
The janitor doesn't have to adopt, probably because they don't work directly with students.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Okay? And then you just kind of continue to go through here and use what use what you know about or what you've learned about, or maybe your personal experience with, how do we help people make decisions to adopt things in an organization like a school and see how that works out?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:36.000
You can always, if you get really frustrated with this, you can always just say, start a new game, and you can back out, and you can log in and start a new game.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
It'll give you that option, or someone else can be playing a game.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
You could also be playing this in parallel if you want it to.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
If you're in a group of 2 or 3, both of you could be running the game.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
But I want you to be talking together about this and sharing your strategies.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
So if you can also share your screen in your breakout.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Okay, what questions do you have?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
So it sounds like we can choose. Once we run our breakouts.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Either we both do individual or one shares a screen event.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Yeah, you decide how you want it, how you wanna manage your your own group, play on that.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Okay.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
You don't have to be stuck on one screen, or you could even start with one screen.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
And then, and then you could also then branch off if you wanted to still talk about what's going on or I'm gonna try this.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:31.000
What had happened, and she can share screens and show that if you want to that, you know, you can decide how that would work best for you.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Other questions.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
I can tell. You're just excited to get started with this.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:45.000
So let's see if I can get to breakouts.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Or my breakouts.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Breakout rooms. Great! Alright! I think we have what 8 people 8 people so I'm gonna do 3 breakouts.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
And I know if you have, if you have to leave, step away for a moment.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
If you're in a group of 3 and you know you need a break, or whatever.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Take a break if you're in a group or 2 you can still take a break.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
But you know, figure it out. How does we play this for a while?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
It's gonna take a little bit. I'll check back in.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:29.000
I'll start checking in, and about 15 min or so once you've had a chance to kind of talk through how you want to approach this, and it's maybe by then you've got a couple of moves done and then I'll just be kind of going around from room to

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:37.000
room we're not gonna record while we're doing this, but we will do some recording afterwards, and so don't delete your game when we do our debrief.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:44.000
We wanna see some of the things that you're gonna be talking through, and we'll do it we'll do a more substantial debrief to cause in that deep brief, we can also talk about.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
You know the elements of game games to help people learn that we saw we're done.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Well, maybe that weren't done so well. Questions, no more questions.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000
All right. Let's get started. I'm gonna open up all all the rooms, and I might have.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000
I'm gonna move, let's see you. You're taking a break right in a moment.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Are you gone already?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
I can stay for some time and take the break later, after maybe 10 min.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Okay. So what I'm gonna do is as you're in room 3 right now, I'm just gonna I'm I'm gonna move some people around.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
So I'm gonna put you in your rooms and I'm gonna move a couple of people around.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Okay, so hang on.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Thank you.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
I guess I'm just moving one person around.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Linda, I'm gonna pick on you.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Moving to move from 3.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Okay, we are back. If you yeah, I don't know if you were able to take a break if you needed one.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
If you need to, you could, you know, do so in anytime.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000
My intention is not to keep you here for 2 h a without you getting a body of your seat.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:59.000
That's not good for anybody. Let's take a look.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:13.000
What I'd like you to do as you when your group has a chance to talk is to show your screen, show your game board, and talk about some of the things that what you talk about, how you how you did, what you did, what were some of the challenges, what were some of the things you learned, about

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
6, and if you have anything else to add, that'd be great.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
We have some time to spend on this, so do we have a volunteer group to go first.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Group 3 can go first.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Okay. Group 3, you are up. We're recording again.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
By the way, welcome to those of you watching our recording.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Yes, so do you want me to share the screen? You said, or?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Yeah, we can do that. We didn't really get a chance to screenshot anything and list our thought process on the share notes.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Yeah, you you well, the other thing is, you guys could be filling out notes if you want to while we're doing the debrief as well.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
We all have access to that. So.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
So. Did you want me to talk first, and then you you can kind of fill in whatever.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Yeah. Yeah. However, you wanna go about it.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Okay, yeah. So we it took for us. It took a couple of minutes for us to kind of understand the way setting.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
So that's why we went kinda went back and forth, back and forth in terms of who's doing what?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:29.000
So. And once we finally start to catch up on and learn know what it the entire thing meant to be.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
That's when things started flow. So we first chose.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.000
I think the first 5 people that we chose were first, we were just like, Oh, yeah, let's go with the decision makers, or like, you know what it seems like.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:57.000
The. So we want for principles. I think first we want with the math chairman, and then one of the social studies teacher and signs teacher and then library person.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:04.000
I I believe so. And then we were kind of looking at it without really looking at the chart on the side, on, like the info.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:12.000
On this interest in trial. First, we also kind of didn't really realize what that meant.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Oh! Is it not sharing?

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Everything. You're sharing. The lunch meets.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Oh, it's fine, too, but I guess everybody's looking at the same screen, so we don't have to keep looking at.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Yeah.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Yeah, I thought that might help you. Just kind of talked about what our thought process was.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Right, right, right.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
With that we chose be I go back to it.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Yeah, no, that's okay. That's okay.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Okay.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Alright!

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Because we're already looking at a screen. So that's the first people were kind of random, without really any thought behind it.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:53.000
And once we start realizing what the interest column meant, what the like awareness call meant, we are.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:02.000
We with a second batch of personal to get more information, we were a little bit more careful, and then we would got to the lunch based out. The screen is showing is show.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Who's close to what or not as close to who's hanging out with, who?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Right.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000
So that this information helped a lot for us to figure out who we can talk to.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Like in the diffusion activities and then ask for help.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:26.000
So for me personally, I first I was like, let's go with the big guys, which is seems like group ones like there's 2 chairman's in there.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:34.000
There's principle in that group. But at the same time later, realize, okay, not everybody's easy to convince.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:40.000
And they're not really all willing to open their ears to whatever we're trying to do.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
So ever it kind of stepped in, and so we chose for a couple of people from different groups as well.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:50.000
That group 2 was, if okay, they're not too hard to easy.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Group theory was like easy to group, to convince, and then group 4 was another pretty okay group.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So we decided to, you know, talk to like a couple people.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:17.000
I could not couple people like at first, I think, ever I forgot what order we went, but I think we select the people from Group one first or no.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
We try to do somebody who's come work easy to convince.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:27.000
So there's a time that we're just oh, yeah, let's just go after people who are easy to convince.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:37.000
But when we actually started to pay attention to the information of people, we're like, okay, just because they're easy to convince the Zoom Meeting, they're gonna be a lot of help to our whole decision-making process.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:48.000
For example, like Group, the staff, the science structure is very easy to convince, but, like his distinform is that he's a little erratic.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:57.000
So with that characteristic, it may not be a good mix or not so much health from you know when he's together with other people, so that might cause some trouble.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:07.000
So he could definitely, really help. But, like, you know, we didn't wanna rely on that just easy to convince factor of it.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:17.000
For Group of the Member H. Size teacher. That person was okay, like he has, like a 5 points on, like a convincing love.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:31.000
But if you read that this information on that this person is seems like it's logic-driven, has a lot of respect from the teachers, and so once we convince this person, then we will be able to get a lot of help from it.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
So once we start understanding that factor, we will be able to.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:42.000
We were able to kinda like plot a little better in terms of what next our next movement movement was, gonna be.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So we were about to try the presentation factor in to see how is gonna go.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
But of fortunate. We ran at a time. We didn't get to do that ever.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Did you want to add anything? How our thought process went?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Yeah, I think the the presentation we had to do something first.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:06.000
I think that was going a little too far into it, but at that point we're we ran out of time.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.000
So curious. If you guys got any further to see how that went or.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Yeah, they're they're gonna show you what they got.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
We're gonna go from your group to the first group and then to the second group.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Do you know where the the log is?

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Can you click on the log, tab? It's on the top.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Yeah. The game log. This kit. I don't know if anyone use this, but this shows you everything you did.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Oh!

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Oh!

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000
If you wanted to keep track of who you it did. I didn't show you that.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Okay, that's could have been, that's okay.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Yeah, that's okay.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Well, I did show you that, but it was mine wasn't populated with anything because I did hadn't done any moves yet, so it could be really helpful right so if you're that change agent, you probably have a notebook a digital or physical notebook, where

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
you're writing everything down, anyway.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I mean, it's very fun like I when you were when you popped into our room.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I kind of sort of complained I was like. This is like picking politics.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Exactly.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Who are we gonna be bu buddy, buddy, with but I guess that's that's reality, right?

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:18.000
So it was very fun. At the end we started having fun with it.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Right, right.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Yeah, you're trying to influence people. Right? You're trying to help them decide to do something that they are not doing now.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Then they may not even know about it. Right? So you start with awareness, and and then you know various pieces of that.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Right.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
It's very real. I mean, the specifics are obviously made up.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.000
But there are real experiences behind much of this.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Okay, yeah, I think that's pretty much it, unless.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Okay, okay, well, let's let's go what do you have with anything else to add about what you did?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:00.000
So you ended up with what 2 adopters and a bunch of you've made some influence with some other people, and and you went through.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Yeah.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
What did you go through a whole academic year, or just?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
What do you mean by a whole academic?

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Well you had. So there were 2. There were 2 academic years.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Oh, yeah.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Each one had 36 weeks. Go back to your main screen and up to the top.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Okay.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
I just want to see how far you went, because the pace you go through here will obviously matter to.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Yeah, not too far through the first year.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
That's impressive.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Yeah.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Oh, thank you. We were. Yeah. We took some time to figure out what we're supposed to do.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
So that's why we're ended there. So.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Yeah, so you just a little over half a year.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Just talking to.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Pretty efficient, I think, if you continue this, probably you probably would have been very successful and completed well within your timeframe of 2 years.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Oh, really. Okay, cool. Thank you. Alright.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Hey? We probably would renew your grant for another year of implementation.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Alright. Thank you.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Okay, let's go to. Let's go on to group one group, one can.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Can you? This is Adam and Adrian and Dalton.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Can you share your work?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Yes, alright! Here we are!

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:33.000
So we we made it through. We are, you know, in the fall, our second year we have one adopter, the science chairman, which I believe Everett and Linda.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:44.000
You also had as a adopter, I think one key was, when did Dr. B.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:55.000
You pointed out that these bars are significant in getting someone to adopt.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Dalton, or Adrian Jeff. Anything else add, I'm have other things.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:09.000
I wanna say that I'm trying. I think, as I was the one sharing my screen, trying to think about what our process was, and you all could help with that.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Yeah.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Thanks, jumping a little bit, because I mean I was so impressed by the first group because we're like in year 2.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Our strategy was more of like getting Intel on everybody in the school which cost us a lot of weeks.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.000
But we thought that we could be strategic and approaching people.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
But I definitely think going through this process, we're learning about the diffusion theory.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And we end up pulling up the reading about. You know the characteristics of an early adopter and the late adopters to help us later on in the game.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:53.000
I think that was, yeah, I I was really we were you when you made that point, Adrian.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Later later on. That was helpful, because I think, as I must say, maybe kind of went into this just a gamer was like, oh, we're just playing a game.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
It didn't quite think about it in the context of learning.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
And once I did it was like, Oh, we're trying to be.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
We're trying to apply what we're learning to.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:17.000
This game and that helped me think about this in a different way.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Yeah. And then the thing I struggle with.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Yeah, it's, it's.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Oh!

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Go ahead!

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.000
I think I struggle with this as a teacher, you know I sort of.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
I relate to a lot of things we're set in within the gain.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Lots of comments here, and I assume certain things would have some kind of effect, and the game just didn't really follow up.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:57.000
So I was a bit confused about what actions were triggering, what things like the the relationship diagrams we were making, assumptions that like, Oh, we're, gonna you know, have this whole group who are friends who sit together and lunch traveled together, maybe that's gonna have a bigger impact and it

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:11.000
didn't seem to have any impact on game. So we were making a bunch of assumptions about what we just didn't know which inputs LED to, what outputs.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Yeah. That's certainly one of the challenges.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
The other thing is that sometimes the things you might think have an impact.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.000
May, the game may be programmed so that other things have to be in place before the impact can be there, especially if it's a logical impact.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Well, yeah, it makes sense that this would happen. Why didn't this happen?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Well, maybe so. Maybe the way the game is coded essentially the model.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
The game is following, says, these are the they have to be at a certain level or other kinds of things before you can have the impact that you think you're gonna have.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000
I don't know exactly what it is, but that is part of using games right?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Games are all built on models, and those models have assumptions in them, and sometimes those assumptions.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:57.000
You may not be aware of them, and they they may not be accurate all the time, either.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Right.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
My network seems to be having some trouble. So I put my video off alright.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
So you guys, what was your score was one adopter.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Hum, and you went through over a year right? See?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Yeah, just over a year. Okay? And you are learning along the way.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Okay.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Clearly, there's a difference between the game that's built around certain concepts that you're trying to help students learn or people learn as opposed to a game that's built as a game that you end up using to help people learn something important even though it's may not be the intention of

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:44.000
the game, this, this is. This is more of a educational game as opposed to a a game used in education.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:48.000
I I guess there's a difference. There!

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Right.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Alright. We'll talk more about that in a minute. How?

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:03.000
How about group 2. How did you guys do? Can can you share your work?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
That is with our group. Right? Let me go ahead and share my screen.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Alright. So we play through again. Let me know if you guys can see my screen.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.000
It's it loaded. Yes.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Is it on? Everybody can see it alright, so we play pretty much throughout the 2 school years.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000
The 72 weeks. Basically, I just wanna point out that this gives a lot of reading.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:41.000
It's not really, really relaxing kinda again at first place, when you try to learn this thing because there's a lot of rule and things you try to work.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000
But once you get it, it's pretty simple to understand.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Or strategies. And here to bring out their awareness, interests, and even up to trial and adoptions.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:03.000
But I think like what everybody get has been, point out.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Basically, this is just like a plane with policies and knowing what people are doing, what and how people are related to each other.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:26.000
So, for example, if you know a launch mates and also the committee diagrams and a social diagrams, you know, the janitor is not really handing out people, and I think also one of the the staff also here, as mentioned Africa who that individual was.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:50.000
But you need to know who is body body with food and who is doing things with who and if using those to get to, you know, to increase their to make them know like a where, what you do and bring up the interest, I guess, within each department's like you know, once you get the

00:51:50.000 --> 00:52:05.000
chairperson, or at least one of it. Yeah, once you get ahead, the chairperson is really easy to get a rest of the department and principle is kind of tricky, cause before you can talk to the principals, you need to get you need to get really close to the secretary.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:22.000
And then you can bring out a principles, interest and principle doesn't really do much, but when you reach to, when your principal is all full, like, you know, get adoption from here, I think you can use the composion or the confrontation, those 2 last 2 moves

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:29.000
that's gonna cost you a lot of weeks. If you roll a dive if you use it, it's pretty.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000
It could be amazing, too bad. We issue to the end of a game.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000
We don't have. We only have. We only have like a one week left, so we couldn't really pull out of both to use the principle to make a big influence over the campus over.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:51.000
A over the school, but I think one of our options was using the local medias to promote.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:54.000
That one's really helpful and principal.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000
We like stuff. So yeah, overall, I think this is all I can share.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Danny, can you share the game? Log?

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Sure I think I have this. Give me 1 s. We can walk.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.000
That's impressive.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
You got 13 adopters. That's amazing.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Oh, yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. So this is my game lock at a beginning.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
We kind of wasting a lot of times just to know people and talk to people.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:38.000
If I know people we try to talk to, you know, couldn't work, and then eventually realize you gotta get everybody's info first and then you can talk to them.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
And once you start talking to them, or you know, try to ask for help.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Those starting, burning their awareness and interest of what you do, and you can do a lot of things from there.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000
So really, it's like Lena. It's a policy game.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Yeah.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Wait! Hold on! Let me get this right. So move.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Move 30 you're doing mass media like I don't.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:09.000
I mean good on you to figure this out, but like I just, I can't get past this like that.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Yeah, it is, unrealistic. I'm not really looking at it realistically.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000
That seems to be so unrealistic. You know it.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
I'm just playing this as a view. Yeah.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Yeah. Yeah. No. Well done.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Yeah.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:30.000
This is also it's written for a context that's very different than any of the contexts around the Bay area.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
I'd say that's just one of the things.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:49.000
And so that's part of understanding. I mean, as part of the game is the context that it's created for.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Oh!

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Yeah, and we're trying to do the confrontation bonnet a one week left so we couldn't use it any. They came to say, You're not yeah.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Huh! What what did you think that was? Gonna do?

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I'm not sure.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I think that I remember it is being explained that we like when you have the option available.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
It's gonna cost you like 5 to 6 weeks.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Yeah.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:15.000
But basically, if you get a principle, your principle is fully, it's in the adoption.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:30.000
And if you use computation or composure in one of them like you can roll it, die, and then to just, you know, massively increase everybody's interest in creating that. You know the red, the red sell but it's a risky move.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Basically. But it's like all for nothing.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Yeah, is that is that is that like a, yeah, is it like a a point where you just basically are telling people, we're going to do this, or you know?

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Yup, it's just basically reinforce like, listen, we're doing this.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Now, if you get a policymakers, yeah.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Okay. And either it works or it doesn't.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Hmm, okay, yeah. Interesting okay, way, anything to add?

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:06.000
It's just take a long while for us to figure out how to.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Yeah.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:19.000
How do you understand the game? And at the very beginning we all complained that this game wasn't is not fun is about reading but a little while we get into it, and especially Danny progress a lot.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:24.000
And he feel very interested in this game.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Yeah, well, here's a question for you. Do. Games have to be fun to be effective.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000
For me. Yes, motivation. First.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:38.000
So right. But these are these are games. So these are games.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.000
I mean I guess I think part of it depends on how you define a game.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:50.000
If the game is something I am choosing to do in choosing to stay engaged within the obviously the fun factor might be really important.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:55.000
There, but you can have an add you can have. You can have an application like this, which is, which is a game.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Essentially it follows the typical rules of games and things like that.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.000
Characteristics, of games, but it doesn't necessarily have to be fun to be effective in this situation. Why?

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Because you're being tasked to play it, you know, it's like an assignment you're gonna do now whether you go off and you all have the link to it. Now.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:25.000
So, and go off and play on your own time, and see if you can actually get to all those adopters and see what the what the success might be. But if you were, if this was part of your real job.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.000
And this is what you needed to do. And you went through this you'd find some things that like, okay.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
So the literature is saying that some of these things would be affected.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
I go through it, and I don't do very well.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Maybe you give yourself a limit of an hour okay, I'll play for an hour, and you don't do as well.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:46.000
But you've learned something so you can go back through again and play it again and see if you're improving your score. So you're learning as you go.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:55.000
And so that's where it becomes really a learning tool when you have the opportunity, could go back and go through its multiple times, especially if you're goal.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Personally, is I wanna be able to solve the challenges that are presented in this.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:06.000
You know, situation like this, because this is what I want to be able to.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:23.000
We should, you know, tell you, if I at I spent a long time as an administrator here, it would have been really helpful to have something like this, not this game, but something like this for new administrators, especially in academic affairs, because none of us came from you know this kind of a you know

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000
there's a lot of politics, a lot of influence that goes on in helping people make decisions.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:32.000
And everybody's got projects. They want your support for, but no one is really trained in how to do this.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:42.000
So you all have to. We all have to learn kind of by trial and error. You know the game of life.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:49.000
So, okay, I think this is challenging. It's challenging for me.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:54.000
I don't know was I? Whenever I do this I usually play off on the side.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
I didn't this time, but I don't do much better than anyone else.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
On this in part, because I'm just doing it on my own.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.000
But yeah, there's some kind of key principles there.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
So what's?

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:13.000
So for those of you who are able to put some notes in here.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Thank you for that. If you want to put some more notes in here, it would be helpful, I think, and I hope that our asynchronous learners, you guys, will also try to do the game.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:25.000
You've seen in heard some of the things that we did see, what you do.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Put yourself, get yourself a clock for an hour and say, Okay, I'll play this game for a hour and see what I learned, and then you can add to this as well.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:40.000
The last thing for you to do this week. Really? Then, is to be part of the game for an hour and see what I learned, and then you can add to this as well. The last thing for you to do this week really, then, is to be part of the I synchronous. Discussion and we've got you know we've got a

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:46.000
we'll pick it up with engaging students through coding and making.

00:59:46.000 --> 01:00:03.000
One thing I want to also call your attention to is, I was able to make a arrangements for our digital media studio in the library at San Francisco State to host us or anyone who wants to be there Wednesday.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
That's next week that next week, 2 weeks from tonight a little earlier, they're not usually open.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Our normal hours. And so they would like to have us there for 5 to 7 at the most.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:22.000
So 5 to 6, 30 ish some of us will be there if you want to be part of this, let me know, and I'll make sure that I give.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:38.000
I help you make, you know. Figure out what what information you need to get there, and what what we're going to specifically be doing, and how that's going to work out after this is our normal class with is the presentations for tech demo that's yeah, tech demo 2 and

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
we'll do those, because, many of you won't be part of this of the VR.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Piece, probably, so I don't know to keep that from you, so we'll do that.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Live if you are here on, Callus at the library, and you want to do a live presentation.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:01:01.000
We do have a room in per call that we can use for that or we can just continue to do them all online either way, I'll be online, either in my office, in the classroom.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Perhaps even in the library. So that's on the Wednesday, April, April twelfth.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Okay, once it makes, I put that up. I did that instead of doing the game myself.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
So it would be there for everyone. So let me know. I've heard from a few of you already.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Alright!

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Any final questions or comments. Everyone knows what to do.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
I had one question just about like when we're talking about games.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Is that different than like the the term gamification.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Are they related, but also distinct.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.000
I don't think I think someone else can answer that.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
But I'm I'll answer it if no one else can.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I'm sure someone else can. They're clearly related right?

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.000
But they're not the same thing.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Anyone, wanna take a stab at that? What's the difference between games or learning games? Even?

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And gamification, or gamification. I'm not even sure how to pronounce it.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Really, I usually say gamification. But, Dalton, what do you think?

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Yeah, I think, pull up my notes. But it's during Google drive.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Buried somewhere, but gamification would be something like for instance, let's say, onboarding to a company, and as you achieve some, you know, sort of badges that are important within the company like demonstrating their values right.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Yeah, like a little badge. Or let's say, you give feedback to appear, and you get badges for that right?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Or like, let's say you give a shout out to somebody, and then a little like mascot dances on their screen and their interface that those are like kind of examples of gamification as opposed to like game-based learning, which is kind of what we just did just now right so gamification would be like

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:59.000
adding elements of games into an experience, but is but the experience itself is not against.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Yeah, exactly. So it's not a game. Gamification is using elements from games like competition.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Alright or a leader with the idea of leader boards and competition kind of go together leveling up, having some having some choice over how I'm going through something where I'm choosing my own path, and some of that could be an element of a game that you'd bring

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:28.000
into that. You know those kinds of things. So that would be gamification, and if you do a quick search on gamification, you will find so much on that.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Okay. Yeah, that's what I thought. But it was helpful to get clarity.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Now that we've did something like this.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Okay. Alright. Well, thanks a lot. I look forward to seeing you online again in the forums and through the notes.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:55.000
And all the other stuff that we do, and let me know if you're interested on April twelfth, and we'll get that together, and then I will see you back online next week.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
So long!

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Bye, bye.Good night.Bye.
