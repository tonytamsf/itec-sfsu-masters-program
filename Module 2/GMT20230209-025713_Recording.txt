00:35:44	Maristella Tapia:	I do appreciate you coordinating these due dates with other classes in the program. Last semester there were intense overlaps!
00:35:57	Stephen Cadette:	Likewise! Ty
00:37:02	Linda Kim:	Yes
00:37:04	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	Yes
00:37:06	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	YES!
00:37:11	Sadia Shaheed:	yes\
00:37:14	Linda Kim:	i would love to learn about that
00:37:18	Stephen Cadette:	Same!
00:38:46	Maristella Tapia:	Our students are
00:39:47	Maristella Tapia:	text prediction, voice texting, eg
00:48:28	Amanda Deigan:	A topic related to AI though, right?
00:51:06	Maristella Tapia:	I just got this email about an event that is happening tomorrow about AI in higher education https://web.hypothes.is/event/liquid-margins-38-hypothesis-on-chatgpt-tbd/
00:51:27	Stephen Cadette:	I've heard CNET is publishing articles written by AI.
00:52:18	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	I‚Äôm excited!
00:52:27	Stephen Cadette:	*ceased a year long practice of publishing AI-written articles
00:55:16	Linda Kim:	linkedin-
00:55:21	Wei Lu:	No, I don‚Äôt use social media in my class, but my school has instagram
00:56:39	Stephen Cadette:	It would be amazing if schools could adopt an attention-grabbing form of social media that is used to deliver/reinforce content as a *primary* purpose.
00:57:00	Stephen Cadette:	But I think as soon as it's school based, it loses that attention-grabbing factor.
00:58:58	Wei Lu:	Here is CTA's Social Media Privacy and Security Guide.

01:04:19	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	I think us teachers need more training on how to deliver the information and mindfulness techniques around digital social media literacy, in a way that‚Äôs developmentally appropriate for students. (But is there such a thing? Is it even possible?) Like the quote from the reading: ‚ÄúAn unfortunate fact is that you can train someone using behaviorist techniques,¬†and the person doesn‚Äôt even know it.‚Äù
01:10:52	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	Yes we use google products
01:10:53	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	I‚Äôve agreed to them a lot! Read them? No
01:10:56	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	lol
01:11:06	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	We use a lot, google classroom everything
01:13:54	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	https://www.google.com/drive/terms-of-service/#:~:text=As%20described%20in%20the%20Google,store%20in%20your%20Drive%20account.
01:15:16	Linda Kim:	I kinda came to accept things like that because it's so ‚Äúnormal" for us to agree on data sharing for anything. If you have any smart devices and/or use any platforms....it became inevitable.
01:15:55	Linda Kim:	LOL
01:16:01	Stephen Cadette:	Maybe it
01:19:28	Linda Kim:	the convenience is so strong.
01:21:30	Maristella Tapia:	I think some apps actually listen into conversations. Is there any proof of that or do people know anything about that?
01:21:46	Linda Kim:	They do.
01:21:59	Linda Kim:	that's one way to get targeted ads
01:22:11	Maristella Tapia:	Crazy! Do you know which ones?
01:22:18	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	I have also heard that phones interact with other phones that are nearby, people you spend time with. Does anyone know if that is true?
01:22:32	Linda Kim:	apple tags
01:22:43	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	Yes also through IP address of internet connection
01:22:44	Linda Kim:	they bouce off apple phones to use
01:22:50	Stephen Cadette:	Smart devices and apps like google home or amazon alexa,
01:23:03	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	That‚Äôs why you see ads of stuff that you discuss with someone at their place
01:24:17	Dalton Lobo Dias (he/him):	The app is not listening, the algorithm is doing it‚Äôs thing
01:24:22	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	I have had similar experiences too, Mari
01:24:28	Linda Kim:	big data
01:26:19	Maristella Tapia:	We had to get a new garage door and we can open it through an app!
01:28:00	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	Even though these terms are really robust, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it is written in fairly ‚Äúplain language‚Äù
01:28:05	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	And not ‚Äúlegalese‚Äù
01:29:06	Maristella Tapia:	good point, Adam. It‚Äôs good that google makes this accessible for folks
01:29:25	Linda Kim:	most of time, there is an option to opt-out for apps/devices listing to you
01:53:05	Stephen Cadette:	same as with SFUSD
01:54:15	Stephen Cadette:	thanks Danny
01:54:24	Danny Cheng:	üëç
01:59:30	Adam Hill (he/him/his):	Oh yeah proctorio!
02:00:01	Brian Beatty:	We have an academic senate policy that prevents us from using tools like this for class-level assessments
02:00:37	Brian Beatty:	Recent legal action, too. About the privacy issues I think.
02:01:54	Brian Beatty:	Terms of Service for turnitin?
02:09:16	Maristella Tapia:	comcast? lol
