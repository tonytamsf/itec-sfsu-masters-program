One trend we are going to see in education that hasn’t received much
discussion yet is the shift from students as consumers to students as
creators. This is part of, but not the same thing as, the Maker
Movement. In fact, it may usefully be described as what needs to
happen before the Maker Movement can reach its full potential.
Traditionally, students are trained to consume large amounts of
information over the course of the first twenty-some years of their
lives, culminating in what we call an education. Engagement and
interaction are necessary and universal parts of the process, but

creation traditionally is not. Creation–the act of producing something
new with what you’ve learned–resides on the back burner, invited into
the spotlight when it is needed and of peripheral importance when it’s
not.
Shouldn’t students be creating at least as much as they are
consuming?
Granted, we’ve learned to cultivate creative impulses in our students,
to bring out the best of their inner talent, and even to test for creative
thought over factual content. But shouldn’t creativity be more
fundamental, more tangible than this? Shouldn’t it be the rule, and not
the exception? And shouldn’t our students be creating at least as
much as they are consuming?
These questions, among others, need to be addressed before we
remove the scaffolding of the Maker Movement and aim for
widespread adoption. Only when pedagogy acknowledges creation–
not just being creative, but actually making something–as the very
basis of deep learning will we be able to say we’ve made this shift.

Why Is It Important to Create?
In the modern world, the skills and qualities that we associate with
creativity and ingenuity are required to help us work more effectively
together. Being able to come up with new ideas and solve everyday
problems is also important for people on a personal level. It plays a
critically important role in learning and personal development, as well
as building self-esteem.

Creativity can also make you smarter. Jennifer Wiley’s lab at the

“creativity-booster”) helped participants solve tricky word problems.
Mareike Wieth and Rose Zacks demonstrated that undergrads were
better at solving insight-based problems when they tested during their
least optimal time. This means that night owls did better in the
morning while morning larks did better in the afternoon.
Counter-intuitive findings like these scattered psychology journals and
made for catchy headlines in the press. The neuroscience of creativity
has been flourishing for nearly a decade. In 2008 the journal PNAS
published a paper by researchers from the University of Michigan
demonstrating that participants who played a difficult working
memory game known as the n-BACK task scored higher on tests of a
fundamental cognitive ability known as fluid intelligence: the capacity
to solve new problems, to make insights and see connections
independent of previous knowledge.
In other words, the task made people smarter. Oshin Vartanian,
Adjunct Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto-Scarborough,
explained that a lot of researchers are excited about this finding.
“The 2008 paper has had a profound effect on how creativity
researchers think about creativity. Now scientists are working on
replicating the results and figuring out if intelligence gained from the
n-BACK task transfers to other domains.” The hope is that “cognitive
training” will help children and adults boost creative output. “The
application of this research is probably the most exciting idea in the
cognitive science and neuroscience of creativity,” says Vartanian.
Creativity serves more practical purposes, too.
For CEOs, creativity is now the most important leadership quality for
success in business, outweighing even integrity and global thinking,
according to a new study by IBM. The study is the largest known
sample of one-on-one CEO interviews, with over 1,500 corporate
heads and public sector leaders across 60 nations and 33 industries
polled on what drives them in managing their companies in today’s
world.

About 60% of CEOs polled cited creativity as the most important
leadership quality, compared with 52% for integrity and 35% for global
thinking. Creative leaders are also more prepared to break with the
status quo of industry, enterprise and revenue models, and they are
81% more likely to rate innovation as a “crucial capability.”
What’s more, there appears to be no doubt that creativity is of great
economic importance. Sir Ken Robinson estimates that, during 1988
the financial contribution generated by creative industries in the UK
amounted to £6 billion. By 1998 this figure had grown to £60 billion–a
ten-fold increase. Employment in these industries grew 34% over the
same period against a background of almost no growth in the
economy as a whole.
Creativity, therefore, is widely regarded as a vital component of
economic growth.
But Robinson recognises that it is not simply about employing more
people in the creative industries. The qualities associated with
creativity and ingenuity are needed at all levels in both the private and
public sectors. The increased pressure of competition has heightened
the need for employers to be customer focused and working to
achieve continuous improvement. This requires people at all levels
use initiative when making decisions and to think differently. And it all
starts with the quality of your education.
The charge that educational institutions fail to promote creativity is by
no means new. A host of well-known educational thinkers and
practitioners such as Froebel, Montessori, Steiner, Dewey, Piaget and
Bruner have strongly espoused the importance of creativity in
education over the past 100 years and several have set up their own
organisations that operate on the fringes of mainstream education
What is new is the rapidly growing evidence that points to creativity as
an economic and societal solution to many of today’s problems.

“Creative thinking not only enhances our ability to adapt to our
environment and circumstances but also allows us to transform
those environment and circumstances.”
“Understanding, identifying, and nurturing the creative potential is
relevant in education if we want students able to solve academic and
personal problems and challenges, to find innovative solutions and
alternatives, and to have better tools and resources for success in a
fast-changing world,” says Dr. Rosa Aurora Chavez-Eakle, Founder and
Director of Washington International Center for Creativity. “Creative
thinking not only enhances our ability to adapt to our environment and
circumstances but also allows us to transform those environment and
circumstances.”
It’s adaptability that creativity equips us with, and in today’s fastchanging world, it’s a priceless quality to have.
“If our goal is to teach and nurture future scientists, artists, engineers,
entrepreneurs we need to understand and nurture the creative
potential because creativity has provided the foundation for art,
science, philosophy, and technology,” says Chavez-Eakle. “If we want
to teach children to become productive human beings, and more
satisfied with what they do with their lives, we need to support them in
the process of discovering and enjoying their creative potential.”

Helping Your Students Create More and
Consume Less
We all have to consume information in order to gain knowledge, but
that’s only half of the equation. Creating is the other half, and in many
cases the better half. So how do we get students in the habit of doing
something with the knowledge they’ve acquired? Below are a few
recommendations.

1. Begin and end every class period with a creation.

chrome-distiller://4f12f13b-903b-476a-ba30-51ed7fac9f1f_1fc7dfaac2e2f5b78ffef8762326f0a37e0691a625e0f740c92d5bc2186dbbe5/?title=Students+As+Creators%…

It doesn’t much matter what it is–a candy molecule or a quick sketch
of the geological record–as long as it gets the creative juices flowing
and leaves the student curious and inspired when the bell rings. You’ll
have to keep it timed, of course, and relevant to your lesson, but I
guarantee the payoff will be worth it.

2. Never lecture for a whole class period.
Or, at least, don’t let your students expect you to. Talking the whole
time–even if you stop to ask questions or divide students into
discussion groups–will only allow students to passively consume,
and subsequently forget, what you are teaching them. Creation must
be a part of every class period.

3. Require students to create products for other students.
Social entrepreneurship is a rapidly growing trend in education, and
for good reason. Creating something to benefit your own life is always
nice, but creating something to benefit other people can provide a
powerful reserve of motivation.

4. Hold content-based tests weekly; hold practical
application tests mid-term.
Psychological research does not support long content-based exams
administered mid-way through the term and again at the end of the
term. But it does support weekly quizzes, which reinforce what we’ve
learned more firmly in our memory than if we cram before major
exams. Mid-terms and finals are completely necessary, but you
should be assessing how well (and creatively) your students might
use what they’ve learned in the real world–not how well they
remember content.

5. Require an ongoing project that lets students record their
own learning.
It might sound funny, but the best way for students to retain new
information is to remain conscious that they learned it. However they

want to record their progress–visually, literally, aurally–is up to them.
Ask them to keep track of it independently, and have them submit it
throughout the term not to be assessed but to make sure they are
doing it.

6. Do not use physical textbooks; use only interactive
learning material.
Why require passive readings when you could require active ones?
Keep your eyes peeled for online versions of textbooks (which you
can write yourself, by the way) with interactive features like embedded
videos and space for note-taking.

7. Apply a cross-disciplinary approach whenever possible.
Nothing enhances creativity like discovering connections between
two seemingly unrelated subjects. Apply science to art, art to science,
poetry to math, and psychology to performance theater as often as
you can.

8. Require creation in every assignment.
This is an important one. Most college homework these days consists
of reading or writing. You’ll be astonished at the transformation that
can take place in student learning and motivation when they are
required to DO something with what they have consumed.

9. Let students create their own syllabus.
It’s common for instructors to pass out notecards at the beginning of
the term, asking students what they’d like to learn or get out of the
class. Take this a step further and ask them (perhaps as an early
assignment) to create their own detailed syllabus, either from scratch
or as an edited version of the one you’ve already cooked up.

10. If you don’t create something, talk about creating
something

Class discussions are often centred around theory, but you can easily
shift the topic to touch on practice. This may be easier said than done,
especially in English or philosophy courses, for example, but the
simple act of trying it out will almost certainly lead to interesting and
meaningful discussions.

11. Establish a Makerspace.
This is a big trend sweeping educational institutions across the globe.
More institutions are building physical paces where students can
learn and create together, integrating content-and-product-based
activities as part of their instruction. Don’t be late to hop on this
wagon–students are flocking towards these spaces with enthusiasm
and talent.

12. Push the unfamiliar.
Highlight the strange, unique, exotic aspects of your subject. Touch
on uncharted territory. Meditate on the mysterious. Students will stop
consuming–and start thinking–if they sense an unfamiliar concept.

13. Shake things up.
It’s easier NOT to shake things up, of course, but it’s also easier to
stop at McDonald’s than to make a meal from scratch. That little bit of
extra effort will go a long way when it comes to keeping your students
interested.

14. Encourage risks.
Every creative act is a risk. We should remind students as often as we
can of the countless rewards that come from leaving the well-beaten
path.

15. Welcome mistakes.
Learning mistakes come in many forms–wrong answers, misheard
instructions, poorly understood concepts–but should always be
recognised as natural, even beneficial. Students today are just as

terrified of failure as they ever were, and it’s our job to let them know
they won’t succeed without it.
