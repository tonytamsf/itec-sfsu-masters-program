00:16:52	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Good point Mari, I think that would make giving feedback easier and faster.
00:18:21	Sadia Shaheed:	Reacted to "Good point Mari, I t..." with üëç
00:21:44	Linda Kim:	no :-/
00:24:09	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Oh no that‚Äôs right it is from this reading
00:33:33	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Cost effective for stakeholders
00:45:07	Sadia Shaheed:	I am interested to know more about the validity/ time limit of assessments, like IELTS is not valid after 2 years! why is that
00:51:17	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Recommendations
Revise practices, policies, and regulations to ensure privacy and information protection while enabling a model of assessment that includes ongoing gathering and sharing of data for continuous improvement of learning and teaching.
States, districts, and others should design, develop, and implement learning dashboards, response systems, and communication pathways that give students, educators, families, and other stakeholders timely and actionable feedback about student learning to improve achievement and instructional practices.
Create and validate an integrated system for designing and implementing valid, reliable, and cost-effective assessments of complex aspects of 21st-century expertise and competencies across academic disciplines.
Research and development should be conducted that explores how embedded assessment technologies such as simulations, collaboration environments, virtual worlds, games, and cognitive tutors can be used to engage and motivate learners while assessing complex skills.
00:54:04	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Yes dashboards would be great for interventions, and getting support and resources for students as early as possible
00:54:08	Dalton Lobo Dias:	And to cue in the support teams
01:00:13	Adam Hill:	Mari - it‚Äôs WeVideo!
01:00:48	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Menti is there
01:01:08	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Under ‚Äòget real time feedback‚Äô
01:01:22	Dalton Lobo Dias:	Miro also there
01:03:54	Adam Hill:	Wei - you did Nearpod, right?
01:06:03	Wei Lu:	Yes, I used it before
01:09:49	Brian Beatty:	This is from early 2019
01:09:49	Wei Lu:	That‚Äôs terrible
01:10:06	Maristella Tapia:	my kid would always be offline
01:10:12	Sadia Shaheed:	I saw this, feels like torture
01:10:19	Brian Beatty:	It relates to our study of AI and assessment and disruptive technology
01:10:47	Brian Beatty:	What is being assessed?
01:11:33	Linda Kim:	more like they are assessing human behavior.
01:11:36	Brian Beatty:	About 10,000 of these devices had been deployed when this was made.
01:12:16	Brian Beatty:	Real time feedback of brain wave activity!
01:12:18	Wei Lu:	That‚Äôs really too much
01:13:07	Wei Lu:	And it seems that students have no choice to say NO to the device?
01:13:23	Brian Beatty:	There is more to the story‚Ä¶
01:13:41	Linda Kim:	it feels like that device is finding a reason to blame the learner for not paying attention- I can see the teacher will point finger at the learner and only ask- why are you not paying attention. Rather then asking themselves about improving their teaching method..?

01:16:15	Dalton Lobo Dias:	I noticed they had a dashboard haha
01:16:24	Dalton Lobo Dias:	And ‚Äòreal time data‚Äô
01:26:50	Linda Kim:	4
01:49:04	Linda Kim:	ok i wasn't crazy
01:51:06	Brian Beatty:	We could not assess without technology in pandemic
01:54:02	Adam Hill:	Danny, You work for SF State, right?
02:02:37	Adam Hill:	Zaption  no longer exists but is very similar to playposit
02:02:49	Adam Hill:	And play posit just got acquired by WeVideo lol
