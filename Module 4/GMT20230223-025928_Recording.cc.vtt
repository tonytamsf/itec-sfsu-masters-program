WEBVTT

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:39.000
People aren't really thinking about this, to be to be useful, useful, or, I guess, useful, practical, and really helpful.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Not a threat, not a threat. This is really helping you right.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And I think that's I think that's the that's an important takeaway for people to hear from their colleagues, from their peers, from other other teachers.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Only the people who care about it are interested are, gonna listen!

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I gotta read it and listen to it, anyway. So you're not to worry about people who aren't interested. I guess they're not even gonna see it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I tell myself all that time.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Just say what you wanna say.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Okay. Thanks. Dalton. Who else wants to talk about what they found, or maybe what, even when someone else found it?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Take a little bit of time for this. Then we'll get on to tonight.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
More specialty. But.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I found it interesting, using Chat Gpt to help me like narrow research that I was doing and help me.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Get to the heart of a question I had, or so I thought so.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I did a little considering my work. I did a little bit of research on like what it's like to study.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:09:00.000
AI, if you're going to go to grad school for it to understand, like how those programs are designed.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Yeah.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000
And it is pretty hard to sift through a bunch of like marketing materials for something like that, because I think a lot of universities are trying to seize the moment and market their programs in go in asking what that learning experience is like to chat Gbp, I did get some answers just

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the ways that you might city robotics and mathematics and computing, and also ethics and philosophy.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And then so I. And then, when we were doing some of the discussion forums, I also found that it was much easier to get answers to research questions. I had.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
If I was just trying to like, gain more knowledge on a topic, it almost felt like.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This is like a more like a directed formal of Wikipedia.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Uhhuh.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:47.000
However, I was talking to a good friend of mine who's a lawyer, and he was saying that he is some of his calls for playing around with Chat Tbt, and literally like sometimes like you really have to question the accuracy of what you're getting in there because like they were literally like legal cases

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that Jack Dbd. Cited, that were just made up so.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I don't know. Yeah, like the accuracy of the information that we are getting from Chat.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Yeah.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Gbt like it's not really cited and like, so I'm as much as I'm excited for it.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I'm trying to understand, like, how useful it can be for trying to get more niche knowledge.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And then, like, is that also helpful way to you know, we always were concerned, about, especially at the outside Wikipedia, like, Oh, well, students, just use Wikipedia, especially when it's an accurate well, it seems like Chat Qpt.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Can be similar.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Yes, I mean to me it feels a lot more like the kinds of stuff I'd see written on blogs that are that are still are very useful, but they're not usually very rigorous.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:47.000
They can be, but more often than not, you know it's more generalization and kinds of things, and telling stories about something, maybe having a link to an example or something like that maybe a reference or 2.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But it doesn't seem to be doing. It doesn't seem to have that capability.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And I think it's probably because of how it's being trained.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And what is learning from because it's learning, I think, from publicly available stuff it can find on the Internet.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I, you know. Actually, that I'd be very interested in know how these things are.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Actually, you know, what is the database, and I think I think that's the database.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Right.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Primarily, I don't think it's to be deep into, like all of the database that are available on line of you know, reference articles like Pub met, or things like that, and maybe it is.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But I don't think so, cause it cause, if if you think about it, I don't know as I think about, I should say if it was looking that deep into things like that.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Wow! That's that. Maybe it is that big of a training kind of information that that's it's being trained on.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Or why it does these. The responses are so fast, literally a second right or 2, and it starts answering most most of the questions I've asked it starts answering pretty quickly, pretty quickly.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And Tony, I know, is I don't think is here.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Live with us, has paid pays for the upgrade he pays for the $20 a month, and I don't know if he's getting, you know, quicker responses, or if he's getting more detailed responses or anything like that.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But that at some point may become part of the part of the business model.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
For tools like this, especially, you know, for the for the publicly publicly available tool access.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
You. You want more depth, pay for it. You want more speed, you pay for it right?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And that that's also a selling. If these tools can do that at some point that could be a really powerful sailing point to go into someone else's system, though, of course, hey, use our system, and we can get you this through our AI you know our open AI

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
powered, you know, whatever you wanna call it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Helper!

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So do you think it's gonna get? I mean, would it be helpful to have these language models actually offer, you know which database do you want to pull the data from right?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Or is it just not enough data? Does it really need a much, much more massive?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:17.000
You know Brad, of data from the Internet to properly act as a language model, or like, like the pub met example. I really like right.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Right. If it's just published. Yeah, papers.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
What if she's looking from that?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Yeah, well, I have no idea how long it would take for it to kind of build the ability to create answers like it's doing now from a specific data set.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
If it's not already, it's not already data that's in there.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
There's gotta be a time time period for that to happen.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You know, just for it, and I think a lot of it depends upon the rigor and how well trained it has to be for it to be really functional.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And you know it really interesting to hear. Maybe there's some stuff out there we could find where someone could find the share with us already.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Hear someone talk about some of those pragmatic details about how this is really working, because understanding more about how it really works can sometimes help us better understand what you know, what we can trust it for.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And where we should be suspect right? And when we worked, when the university worked with Eab on our advising systems, I may have mentioned that before, but we were training a model.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:29.000
They would not tell us, they would not show us. You know exactly how they're creating their recommendations or their their determinations as a student is at risk.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
This is not that's proprietary, and we don't share that.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They could talk about General. Well, we look at this kind of stuff, and we look at this kind of stuff and we look at this kind of stuff.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But we have data scientists on our own campus is said, we wanna know what you're doing with our students.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Data. And of course they said no. And the university said, Okay, well, we asked cause they wanted the service.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And so so anyway, we don't know. Then we may never know unless you're on unless you're on the inside of this.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So what we need is an insider. Actually, I know some people computer science over across the across the campus and maybe some over there could give me some leads on how I could find out. You know, in a way that might be interesting to you guys alright. Anything else.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
You're all part of this.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:29.000
No one wants to talk about their stuff.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Linda got so good look she got cited not only in this document, but also brought it over into the discussion.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Actually goes to cited in the chat tonight, too. Talk about impact.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Oh, Hi! Oh, thanks, Alton! I didn't see the chat, so I guess I guess I can kinda talk about it a little bit.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I drew you in. Okay?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
No, it's okay. I don't mind.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It's okay. So I kind of started wondering about.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I mean chat. It is amazing. It can do it. A lot of things, but sort of wondering about the authenticating, I think.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Alright authentication. How do we authenticate the information that it's generating?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So cause it gotta pullool be pulling their information from a certain data source.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Right, and I was wondering, how do we? What if it's pulling their data?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:29.000
The generating the answers from like not correct data source.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So I just ask a question. My prom was, how do we authenticate information?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Generate from AI, so it can't kind of give me a general answer, saying, what's indicating?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It generate information. Driver AI can be a complex, but there's a way you to cross check it, basically about online.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And it gave me like 5 prompts or 5 ways.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Hmm!

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
How we can authenticate it. But it's all about.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
People have it, humans having to kind of double check the fact source of it.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Right.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So which I thought was pretty interesting. So I was like, Okay, I mean, and then this kinda reminded me of I don't know if you guys use turn it in.com before I you know, high school, I used it.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's basically a pleasure isn't detecting. I guess.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Saw sights. I haven't used it since high school, so I don't know how much it got better.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:30.000
But before, when I was in high school, the problem it had was it was flagging.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Things were pleasurized. Things like word like the or that, or something very simple, or if it's like a site from something else, and obviously, if it's like a apiece of citation, it's probably in the same or similar for a lot of people, and those keep flagging, as if it was

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
like pleasurize. So it was simple. It was meant well, but it wasn't perfect, so.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:05.000
But I was kinda like I don't know like I was a lot of thoughts on my head, and I didn't really get to the bottom of like, oh, how do we action themicated like by yourself like AI.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
So other than it was telling me. Oh, you have to vindicate it!

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
You have to double check it. So it was. I thought it was pretty interesting.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It didn't do everything for us. Yeah.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Right, right, yeah. You know, I I think this last one.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:33.000
It came up with humor. Oversight it? That's basically an element of every single thing is talking about to some extent this idea of data governance, this this becomes really important when you're training an AI tool on your own data you don't need a you don't need a general purpose.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.000
AI, you know, that's gonna search in the whole Internet.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.000
You wanted to. Just look at your data. And that's how that's how AI has typically been used more often than not.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:50.000
At least the kind of the specific uses that have been have the most of us are aware of so far.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Really this integration into, and I guess integration into now are coming soon into the search tools.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Apparently is, is looking at much more general data sources.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Basically the data source of of the Internet at some point.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Dr. Peter, we're we're not seeing that document.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
It's still on the session. 3 notes.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
I don't know if you're trying to cast a.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
What document?

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
The breakout room notes.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
This one?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Yeah, yeah, we weren't seeing that screen. Yeah.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah, yeah, we were not seeing that there we go. No.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.000
You weren't saying that. Well, thank you for saying something.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
What was I showing?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
It was just a breakout room. Share notes.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Must have been in a different window, or something!

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Okay, sorry about that.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
That's okay.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
I need to have another monitor. That just shows me what you guys are seeing.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:54.000
Okay. Alright. Well, I won't try to pull any more teeth here, so let's move on. AI.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So I'm sure AI will come back into our conversation throughout the semester, and you're welcome to bring it back up into any of our discussions.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:17.000
It it is, I would consider it, you know, kind of the cutting cusp of a largely publicly accessible emerging technology that we're all going to be dealing with, no matter what role we're playing and where what level we're at and what context we're

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:27.000
at in this kind of instructional environment that we are, and because it's about information and information is so key to much of what we're trying to do right?

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:42.000
We deal in information. Right? That's a big part of what I think a lot of us are doing, are we're providing access information where we're asking people to generate information right?

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
We are. We are kind of the in some ways of information workers or knowledge workers.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
I guess you know, depending on how you wanna look at this. So it makes sense.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:06.000
I think, to kind of this is a good. This is a good point for us to be talking now about other kinds of technologies that will give us access to information and a ways to work with information in educational terms.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000
We usually talk about content. Right? We need content. We have such a matter. Experts.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000
And what do they do? They give us content, and then explain things to us, not just content, though right like I said earlier, we don't just you don't.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
You never have content just to have it sitting there.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
You have to. Students have to do something with it. The learners have to do something with it.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So it's content. And it's activities around them.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So for today, for today, I asked you to prepare by looking at a couple of things, and this was the not very much.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Actually this one, this typology of free, web-based resources.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Have you seen that before?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Has anyone seen that before?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
I've seen some of the stuff in there. I mean that.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
This is like a version. 2 of this typology. They did it first in 2015, I believe, and then 2016.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000
They redid it, and they don't redo this every year, because I don't think it changes enough for them to do whatever you, but they will probably do it again in another year or 2.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Edgy cause is one of the major it and education kind of groups around the world, really and dominant.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Peer in the Us. And North America, I say, but when, if you go into this, what they're doing here is they're talking about the different kinds of, and they're focused on free web based learning technologies, right?

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
So these are, these are technologies that you can use reasonably well for free some of them may be freemium models.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
I don't think they. I don't think that's something they would not do.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:51.000
But it has to be support, substantially functional for for you to use free, you know, like I don't know meant to meet as a tool. I don't know if it's in here or not, but that as a free version, and it has a paid version of pro vers just like a lot of these

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
do so. If you look through here you'll see how they you know they do.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Some explicit about what they're doing. Of course this is a kind of a what is this called?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
This is a it's not really data visualization.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
I don't know. Maybe it's not really numbers, though it's just talking like ideas.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
It's more like a concept map it's just a visual representation of the the landscape as they see it.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And they use some color coding here. You can decide for yourself whether or not this is helpful, for you, but you don't have to just rely on that, because there's the traditional Pros text base explanation here and then they go through the different tools.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Yes, Steven, as a question or comment.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Sorry.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
You're muted. It sounds like you have deep thought to share.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Yeah, when we were looking for the concept map, is it is it incorrect to call information data?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Not necessarily numerical, but when we have, and, for example, that's organized in this way, I would wanna call this data visualization or data representation.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Yeah.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
And not only because they're clickable, but because of the way they're relationship is at.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
The relationships are between each other and hierarchical.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I just wonder, I mean, and I know this is probably the wrong class to ask this in.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000
But is it? Is it too generous to call this data?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000
I don't know what are the rest of you think.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Half. You probably either took that class or in that class as well.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
The 7 40 classes where we talk about that does is this a data visualization is really the question, yeah.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I guess you could count right. You could count the tech and see which one has more numbers right?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Well, you. Don't. I don't think you can do account.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Hello, Cody!

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
It's basically using a picture to represent information. And the information is, well, what are the different categories, the types of systems we see are the platforms.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Being used to support learning, you know, with technology free and on the web.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
And so it's kinda it's like I would consider this similar to a concept map.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
It's not really a concept map, but it's that kind of organizational scheme.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
It's a visual organizational scheme.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
So, yeah, and it does show relationships like you mentioned. So I think, there you go.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I think the answer is, it's not incorrect.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
All right.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Thank you.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Yeah, wouldn't it be nice if you could? Well, what about an interactive tool like image-based tools?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
What if I click this? I go right to them so it's a little bit interactive.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
And then if I go back, I don't go back to the picture.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Unfortunately, so it's not really interactive. It's clickable.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
So it's a clip. Clickable map. I'm okay. I care about.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Let's say, 3D modeling tools. Okay? So now I can go to 3D modeling modeling tools.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Here we go! I haven't looked at all of these.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I don't know if you've looked at any.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Sometimes they go away. Of course it's been what 2 years it's probably been 3 years since this was written, and so some of these may have gone along the wayside, although they all the names I see that I recognize are still are still there.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:25.000
But sometimes they change. Of course you, as you go through this, you'll see tools that you've used or you've heard about, or have you had colleagues use, and these are some things that you might want to take a look at, and and try out and play around with, as a matter of

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
fact when you're looking at newer technologies or different technologies to do different things.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:40.000
If you know that there's a tool, a whole group of tools here that you just have never experience or just aren't in use in your your instance, you might want to take a look and say, Well, what's here?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000
What is is there something here that could be actually useful? Now some of these are really interesting, like the social networking systems.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Well, research Gate itself is. This is what tool I use, and it's it's a way of me kind of summarizing and linking like to the abstracts and the titles of some of the works.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:12.000
I want other people to know I'm doing, or have done, and a way for them to contact me, and I can add a full, full, full full full print of the copy of whatever it is that's being there, or maybe I have them ask me.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
So would they allow you to connect to people and ask questions but it's all around academic research.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Is it a social, networking system? Well, it has some social, networking capabilities but I don't consider it a social network.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I consider is another place for people to find the work I'm doing and for me to search for other people's work as well.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
So is it a social network? Yeah, I guess so. So, you'll find some of that in here, too.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
You might, you might see something classified. You know that you perhaps wouldn't classify it that way.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Has anyone in here use?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:52.000
That's something I know has come up in some of our summer conversations and some class I've been in.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.000
I've like, used it minimally during distance learning.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Our school is trying to decide if they were, gonna do like Google classroom as an Lms or and the school is pretty divided.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:13.000
So we did like see software like 4, I think, and Google classroom for 5 days.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Uhhuh.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:22.000
But I worked with that a little bit because I read a lot of articles on like how he talk and like the interactiveness could be effective for middle schoolers.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000
But most of it was like effective because we use like it was used in the classroom.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:31.000
So, but I didn't really get to interrupt the con cause.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I stopped once. It's not being relevant to my context.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Yeah.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I feel like there's a lot of valuable tools on it.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Okay. Well, maybe you brought it to a conversation at some point. I don't know.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I actually thought the topic of learning management systems is really interesting, because it kind of depending on how the learning management is designed.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:01.000
It does provide multiple tools within. So it's not just like whatever they call it, facilitate the delivery of courses.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Right.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Yeah.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000
But it also has assessment tools and canvass or discussion forums, or, like moodle, is incredibly robust if you know how to use it.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Right.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Right.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
So there, and like all that thing with like interoperability of those 2 things of the other tools within, there.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
So like, yeah, we, it's interesting to to one think about learning management systems is kind of like housing all these other tools.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Potentially, but also they. They can dip their toes into other other areas as well.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Yeah, that's true. We see a lot of that.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000
I mean just the canvas canvas and how they are.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
They are designed to be interactive, to interoperable.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:48.000
So they want to be able to people to plug into them some Lms is not so much, and they are they.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:59.000
They tend to do engagement. They have engagement tools, they have content sharing tools, they have assessment tools, they have administer tools are often part of Lms's.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
There's some data, analytics and some lms that are built in here.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I have to. I have to keep reminding myself that this they're limiting their list here to things that are free online and so there's obviously there's a lot of Lms here that are not on the list because they're not free even though they are all online, and we the other thing we're

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000
finding in and text base. At least we have over the years.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Is that other tools have been kind of reaching out into the world of the Lms.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:41.000
And trying to kind of take over a little bit of the Lms function of saying, Hey, you can just use our tool instead of your Lms to manage your course right there's some publisher sites that have they have been moving in that direction there was a echo 3 60 was a lecture Capture.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
System, and what they started doing a number of years ago was building in and at kind of an active learning, component.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
So they were bringing in discuss forums and other kinds of things, so you could do your lecture, capture your video capture, and then you would automatically kind of connect in different ways.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And that was one reason why we we used to be a customer.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
There is at San Francisco State, and we went away from them because we felt that they were getting away from their core business, and we wanted that.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:14.000
We wanted a lecture solution that was still focused on their core business because we did not want to have faculty who were starting to think of doing discussion.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Forum outside in the and the electricity software system platform, not in the learning management system.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Anyway. Yeah, there's a lot there's a lot in here.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:35.000
And as you, as you, as you, I've read through this, maybe, or maybe you'll scan through it, there'll be there.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Talk about how the landscape changes, Dalton and others who are in attack are dabbling in that area.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
At least you'll recognize that there's a lot of change that happens when a tool actually gets designed, developed and implemented.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
And it's really successful. And then what is it? What often happens?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Part of the business model gets bought by someone bigger, right gets brought into another suite.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Usually to capture that functionality and to use it sometimes to kill that right.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:09.000
They they will buy it. And just kind of say, Okay, we're done with you because we're we're doing that another way.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And you were a threat to us. So sometimes that happens in the business of Edit Tech also.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Okay, questions or comments about this. So many different things listed here.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:29.000
You know it's hard to keep track. Keep track of something like this.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Yeah. Another thing that was interesting to me was, I think, opening up this, I was really excited to think like, Oh, I'm gonna learn about all these Ed tech tools that like I read about on edge surge that like I just can't keep track of all of them because there's just so many and what I was surprised.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Was that there was a lot of stuff that aren't is not specifically designed for education, but is free and can be used for education like Google, Keep, Google, Docs Twitter.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Yeah.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
We're all mentioned here because they're free. So it's just kind of broad in my mindset to the way that we think about what is Ed Tech?

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Yeah.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Does it necessarily have to be because you are selling your tool to districts and teachers?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Or is it how you use it? And that is so, lots of things could be considered.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Right.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Education technology, if it is a product that can be used to facilitate learning in some way.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Very true, very true. Microsoft teams, I don't think was ever really designed for an educational market.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I think it was really designed for their core business market. And yet it's become.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:54.000
It is now, you know it's a major educational technologies in a lot, a lot of schools, especially higher education schools, because it's because of it's, you know, the deep functionality it has, including, you know, good web conferencing and connections to calendaring all that good

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
stuff, Steven.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.000
I think you're muted again.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Sorry. Thank you. It was. Looks like this was written in or published in April of 2020.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Yeah.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Yeah.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
I am so looking forward to seeing what post pandemic post lockdown post distance, learning, year list.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
What is gonna look like?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Yes, but you know I like edgy cause resources because they do a lot.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
They have a lot of due diligence in their process and then they're publishing.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
It goes through a bunch of different eyes, and they get panels of experts and all that kind of stuff.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:49.000
You can find other sources, for, like more current versions of something like this, by just by searching online, Catherine Shrock's blog, which is around technology and education like K.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
12. I think she's kind of more focused on K. 12.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
She does one around, I think, like free online tools for formative assistessment or formative evaluation, or something like that.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Kinda like the you know the things we might do with quizzes or mentometer or other kinds of polling and kind of quizzing software.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And it lists. I think it was 75, and sometimes I cite her side.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:19.000
I noticed I know that her her list of that was most recently updated into 2022, I believe so.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Blog, blog sites that do this are more likely to be updated like this.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:30.000
This is. This is mean. It looks like piece of paper. It's not a piece of paper, but it's gone through that kind of rigorous of print publishing.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
To get to this point, which means it takes time, and so then they're not.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
It's not in a format where they can make just a couple of tweaks.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Oh, these 5 things have dropped off this last month, and here's another.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Here's here's like 5 more that came on this quarter.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:58.000
This is not that kind of a documentary. Other more dynamic documents, perhaps, like, you know, blogs or other kinds of list websites might be that so if you do a search for that, you might find it.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.000
I mean I could find it if I wanted to search for.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
But I don't wanna search for it right now. It was called Echo 3, 60, Adam, and I believe they're still in the game.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
I think they're still a player in the game.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000
They're probably doing pretty well, because overall, though the quality of what they were doing was pretty good.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
All right. Okay, so let me stop that share.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Where we are. All right, let's see what else did I show you?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Oh, the other chat, chpt, link, I put that in there originally because we hadn't done the other one in a couple of videos around the graphics if you're in the 7 40 class, you probably have plenty of that.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Was there anything that you noticed, or you got? It got out of the especially, you know the idea of creating visual representations of information in ways that are, you know, useful, or Adam?

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
You have a hand up question to comment.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Oh, yeah, just quick question. Just for that diagram in that article, does it?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Does that in some ways become the like a foundational text for our projects that will be doing the to use that to eventually think about what we want to do research and present on.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
You mean, like the tools in there, or the organization? Yeah.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Yeah, yeah, either or.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Well, I do I. One of the reasons I share this document now is because it provides you with links to lots of different tools.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.000
You probably haven't heard of most of those. Do I look for them today?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Right.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
I was like, why, I read that last year, but I don't remember that one.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Right.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
So, yeah, you could use that as a starting point, at least.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Okay.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
And it also looks like, you know, and then I like the way that it organizes around function.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
You know, I like to focus on. Okay, what are we trying to do here to support learning and the talk about it from a functional basis?

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:59.000
And then look for okay, well, what tools will do this? And this is one of the reasons why you might find tools that were never designed for what we're trying to do, that we might grab onto.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Right.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Because it turns out it actually does this really? Well, so it's not being sold to us as an educator to develop content.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:15.000
But yet we find, Hey, this is a great thing for having students build, content, or share, content, or find content, or aggregate, content, or whatever it might be.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Gotcha great.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
So I think the answer is, you could use this as a place, a starting point for all that, and they have a list of 200, and I don't have to put them anywhere.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Hmm!

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So you'll also find that you know most as we start talking about technologies more.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
You guys will come in and you'll be able to do little Demos of what you're using for various things, and that'll also be a place where you might find something.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Oh, I think I want to explore that the end. The the idea on the project is that you're looking you're working with technologies that are that are not ones.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
You are already using every day right cause you for you. It's not emerging.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
It's emerged. It's already there. It's functional for you. You.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Could you could take a technology that has a whole other area of functionality.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
You've never used or accept and do with that. But that's not normally what happens.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:05.000
So usually, you find the different technology you either haven't used or you've just kind of dabbled with, but never really applied.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000
And now you wanna figure out how to apply it and use it to support learning.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Okay. So the emerging aspect of it doesn't have to be really doesn't really have to be emerging for anyone.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:24.000
But you normally, it's emerging for at least some of us, because we're often in similar boats or in the similar places.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
I guess. Okay. So you don't have to find a technology that's new for everybody.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.000
That might be a little hard to do.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Harder than we wanted to make it. What do you think, Danny?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I mean, it sounds good to me, you know. Look, I definitely agree.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Finding new technology. That's new to everybody. It's quite different.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And I'm you know, for my work. I'm more more like administrative as a staff when it comes to within the educational field.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
So, for me at least. Experience, you know, kind of with the emerging technology.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:14.000
We'll probably try to see from like the faculty aspect of it, like you know how they can work with technologies in education that's definitely new to me.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Yeah, I mean, when you're not living and working every day in an educational, in the active, educational, supporting learning space.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Then a lot more of this is a lot. There's, I think there's a lot more exploration.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:41.000
And so I you know what we what I need to hear from you especially is if we're getting to the point where we're not making sense to you or are, it's really confusing.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Or you feels a little uncoordinated because we're talking about instructional stuff that is really kind of the life of a teacher that you're not able.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:52.000
You you are not able to connect, to as well as you want, and this is something that you could just bring up to me, too.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Also individually, if you got that way, I don't think I don't think it will, but it I just wanna make sure you know that.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Okay. I also put a whole bunch of links in the in the agenda document.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Of different kinds, of examples, of different ways, of accessing content.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Some of which you may or may may have never used before.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
There are these, you know, the in the threed interactions you know, multimedia models.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:38.000
You can find, especially places like museums or other kinds of places where they want to give you this being their experience. But even though they know you're gonna be there, the whole idea of virtual field trips have any of you ever taken a class or gone on a virtual field trip.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Anyone, ever.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Did you go to outer space in NASA?

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Yeah, we've done some with my students. I think we did some that during lockdown were, no, we were doing like nature nature stuff.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Oh! Did you use any? Was was it a particular?

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Did they do a really good job with it, I mean, was it like really interesting, like immersive, or just more of a kind of flat?

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Well, it was. We kind of created a package of salespaced trips, so we didn't do it with the students.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
This is during that time when we're trying to figure out how we're gonna do online school.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:20.000
So we just sent some material home. We found some that we liked, and then we just had students do it on their own.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Got it. So they did it. They did a physical, not a virtual field trip.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
They did a real real field trip on their own in like regional.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
It was like a VR. But within the desktop.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Okay.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Oh, oh, got it? Okay. Alright. Yeah, yeah. They're really.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.000
There are some really interesting spaces out there that you can.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:51.000
You have free access to a lot of these places. A lot of you know the the public public, any group that has partial public funding like public, you know.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Pbs, or I believe I don't know about the BBC.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:04.000
But they make a lot of their stuff publicly available to a lot of stuff's really high production quality if you can find it, discover network, Nova, that no hold, no over place.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I mean, of course. Then you got things like NASA, and there's there's spaces.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
There's a lot of immersive kinds of things that they've been building that are really interesting.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
And a lot of teachers and a lot of students have really never come across that stuff.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000
They've never seen it, and then it's especially never had kind of a curated experience with it.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
And that's what you would be doing as a teacher, as you're creating.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
You're curating their experience with it. Other kinds of things, other kinds of content that might be relatively new to you.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
There's idea of interactive infographics. Right? We talk about infographics and some of our classes, and we've seen more and more of them.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:49.000
I guess, but interactive intergraphics where you can actually point, click, and pull things around and explore, explore the kind of the data underneath the infographics or the connections among different elements you know, can be really useful.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
And what else do we have here? Let's see data, visualization.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:06.000
This is a link from the tableau tableau. As an example, we can take a look at these kinds of things there are so many different examples out here, and I think that I think the best thing to do is to encourage you to explore some of these.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:20.000
We have. Obviously, we have limited time in our class session type. But I think what we're gonna do next is we're gonna take a break, and then we're going to come back and then give you a chance to explore some of these in smaller groups.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:41.000
We'll probably do 3 breakouts, so that you can take a look at these are other tools that you might use to explore, content, and and expose students to content in different ways, especially ways that are little bit more, maybe more engaging and interactive than just you know, reading something you know, kind of like Dr.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Bady does read this, watch this right, this going outside the box for that one.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
So let's let's take a break for roughly 5 min.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:45:01.000
We'll come back at the top of the hour, and then we will go into breakouts and do some debrief and talk about what's coming next.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Okay, we're back. I'm back at least couple of people are back.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
I just there are lots of different places.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
I just found this other place. Do you see the screen here that says virtual reality?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Eeg based mental wellness lessons just showing up.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Yes. Do you see that?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
No, we're just seeing the canvas page.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Dumb thing. Okay?

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
I think whenever I change I can't split monitors on this, too.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Well, for whatever reason here it is. Here is something that you probably haven't done in school or in training.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Yeah, this is a VR and Eeg based mental wellness.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Lesson site. You can buy a special headset that must have also some electrical surface electrical connections to kinda measure an Eeg electro as stuff, whatever it's called, something.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Graham measures, electrical signals, and it it will teach you will help you kind of you, or support your mental health through some particular lessons.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
I don't know what kind of lessons they are.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Don't know if it works, but they're sold out, so someone must be buying them.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
They probably had more than 3 or 4, and then you can. You?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
But these these are the kinds of tools that you can do with some of these.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Technologies, that for many of us are still emerging, and yet for others people have been playing with headsets for a long time.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:40.000
In some places, especially some of your students, maybe, but probably not for learning, at least not learning in any kind of formal sense.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
So, for most of us, I'd say a lot of the VR.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Applications are probably still emerging technologies and even sites that are using them like some of your school sites might use them.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
I, how how much do you have available to use right?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I've been through some really interesting in-depth, immersive VR experiences like at universities Arizona State. I went through there.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:11.000
They, they have a whole, you know, 3 in an environment, a multi-story environment that was built in construction with one of the Hollywood, VR.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:16.000
People forget the company, but it's all of it's for a biology class.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
And so you go in, and you're you kind of are entering into this environment.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
And it's all these you're kind of going inside a biosphere into the very small levels.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000
And you're seeing all the little creatures and things like that.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.000
And you're walking up and downstairs, and you have 3 or 4 people in there.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
You're interacting with each other and driving these little carts around.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:41.000
It's pretty cool, hugely expensive, though, right? 30 or 40 million dollar project.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:54.000
And it does one thing I mean clearly, could probably be reprogrammed in to do some other things, but that that kind of lets scope, or the cost of that makes it something that is just.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
It's for fun and interesting and engagement, and probably research.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:06.000
It is not for everyday school, it which is not there yet for that kind of that kind of immersive kind of experience. Dalton.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Yeah, I'm a little familiar with these biofeedback tools, right?

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Uhhuh.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000
I've tried some. My students also tried one called the Muse, which I will put in the chat as well.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Those are interesting because they're it's collecting some kind of brain data like different kind of brainwaves.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
And there are some patterns that indicate things like calm and focus.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:34.000
So they claim. But I've tried some, and I think there's something to it.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And there's also even toys like the Star Wars seemed one. Yeah.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:50.000
So I've had students practice using this muse one and also to run experiments and it creates a huge data set which will be perfect for a tableau.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Yes, I'm sure.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
And so, yeah, this, you know, this could be a way that we can actually teach some form of social, emotional learning and or self-regulation. Right?

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
That is actually data backed right and students can actually see the data coming out in real time.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Uhhuh.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.000
And and so you can train yourself, you know. I could imagine something like, you know.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:17.000
VR. Landscape that you could only join if you're calm, and if you're not calm, you go into some other space that helps you get back into that.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Right.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
So, you know, and then, of course, this can also stretch into wearables as well.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Yeah, well, it's this is a, it's.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000
It's sort of a wearable. It's a wearable device, right?

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:41.000
And it's coming to your to your body in different ways, and getting that data kind of like your Fitbed or your apple watch, or whatever other kind of tracker it's getting some sort of body data to do that.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
And so it's very interesting. There's a there's some really interesting research going on.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
I know if I mentioned. I don't think I mentioned this in this class.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Forget when the last time I actually showed people this. But there was this, there was this research going on in China at a school, and they were really they were doing biometric measurements of students looking for attention.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:13.000
And so they were trying to decide to track when students were paying attention throughout the school day, and they were tracking that, and they would get that information to the teachers.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000
But they'd also give that information to this. The parents.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:23.000
So at the end of the school day the kids we get home, and if they hadn't been paying attention so well they had to.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
They were held accountable by their parents and some, when they interviewed the students.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:36.000
That was one of the things that they were saying is that they don't really like this so much if they're not paying attention, because then, you know, they get home, and it's it's not.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Maybe it's not a pleasant experience for them, and there's, you know, so clearly.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:48.000
There are questions about really all of these tools, but especially ones that get a lot more capture, a lot more personalized data.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:53.000
How, are? How are you handling the data? Who has access to it?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
How is it being used outside of, you know me right cause I know you're using this data, and they all do.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
I mean, they're using it to improve products and lots of other things.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
But that's important things. Those are important things to question.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:13.000
So when you decided to use Muse Dalton with your students, did you go through any kind of that kind of analysis or questioning?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Or did you have to answer any questions about that?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.000
No, this was something a student brought to our project. It was a science fair project.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
So the student. The student, was familiar with it, brought it to class.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:32.000
We looked at it, we tested it a bit. And we're like, okay, sure, there's enough data here that we can actually run an experiment just submitted it to Sanator Science fair. This is a few years ago.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Uhhuh.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Cool.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Yeah.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000
And won some kind prize, so she had a really valid, a really clear hypothesis, clear, measurable data, and it it was pretty neat, and I was one of the test subjects.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:53.000
She was testing. Now it's coming back to me. She was testing like the the effect of different music on your brainwaves.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:00.000
So some people are listening to like hot music. Some people were listening to white noise, some people listening to classical music, and then looked at the data.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Okay, yeah, that might be really relevant, especially with the number of students who probably use music or listen to music while they're doing their studies.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:12.000
You know the reading, or they're doing some homework, or whatever even taking tests.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Okay, just another example. So this first group of technologies that we're really talking about today are where we're contents out there.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:26.000
And we're not really generating content, you know. To some extent this is a little different, because your physical activity is generating the information.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Next week, we're gonna talk more about students actually producing content themselves but tonight, let's focus more on students.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Students generate or accessing content. Content. That's out there content.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:50.000
That may be is being experienced. And as it's being experienced, there's some aspect of it being experienced uniquely every time it's being experienced you know that kind of thing walk, you know, you never take the same walk.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:54.000
You never see the same water in a river going by, you?

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
That kind of thing. Yet, being at the river is something that.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Okay. We're at a river, you know. We're not creating the river for that.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.000
So in in the breakout. That I'd like you to do for discussion.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Let's let me pull this up.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Session? 4. Think about this. The you have already are using that may be considered emerging in some contexts right?

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:29.000
What are you using now? Have you? Have you evaluated them for the privacy things we're talking about?

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Have you read the terms of service, maybe, or maybe not. What are? What are the ones you're using now?

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:41.000
For what? For what purposes, what functions some may be. Some of the functions we talked about earlier in that kind of that, that typology.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
And what are what are the? Where are the gaps?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Where do you think the gaps are in your situation for technologies to do things that you don't know exist yet?

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Or maybe there exist. But you know you don't have access to them for some particular reason.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Let's just have that conversation for a bit. We'll put how many people we have 7.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000
We must have dropped off. Didn't wanna do, didn't wanna do a break out?

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Maybe we're gonna still do 3 breakouts because 4 people is too big for a breakout like this.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:20.000
You have to be able to talk. You have to have that social pressure to talk, and so I'm gonna stop sharing.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Do you have the? We'll put this. We'll put this link in the chat again.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:39.000
All right. That's done. We're going to pause the recording and we'll do the breakout for oh, roughly, 20 min or so, and then we'll come back into a debrief.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:45.000
So the recording will pause here. I'll be right here with a smile.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Everybody's back. Super. Let me start the recording again, just to make sure we get all this wonderful stuff back on the record.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Okay. Oh, I missed my. I now was a jump cut now in the video.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I missed it. Anyway, we have room one group, one to start our little debrief report. What did you guys talk about?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Hi! Everyone! So I will be meeting the I guess the talk about what we discussed in our group session.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:13.000
So for the first one we're looking at it really a lot of times we noticed a lot of those terms of services.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Or privacy policies when it comes to those softwares or turn of use.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Really, they use a lot of, I guess, legal languages, and then it's really lengthy to redo them like it's kinda difficult, frankly, from time to time, for us in terms of the needs for supports do for supporting students accessing contents.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Our team. We're looking more from like H. Instructors perspective, you know, at to help students, you know, with the multi language support and just more opportunities to engage more and video game video games to make the contacts more engaging.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Hello, so definitely like us. Whatever is successful like for mobile device or, like, you know, quick access from anywhere and also I was talking about from my perspective as a staff, about like file sharing like trying to find like I secure way to shared documents like for a student to students or even like for students to

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:28.000
instructors, and for our notes. We were looking for some of the tools like one on one computer.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Google classroom nearpad, which is interactive learning platform zoom.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:52.000
And for 5 transfer. We were talking about there is some other file transfers, but I was talking about probably like a docky sign as an example, docusign is mainly only focusing on like paper documents like electronic file.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:14.000
But it's not really like support, like other like, multiple, different types of the files, is very specific and we're looking at the needs that you know, there are no come now these between students and tutor and in need, there's a need any device, not only translate for like written words.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:21.000
But also like speak to it. And this was before Google Translate could do it.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:29.000
And we're also talking about tools to make content now can make kind of boring contents more.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Try to make contacts more interesting. Like less boring, to make more fun, engaging and even competitive.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
And finally, we'll with my example. I think we're also talking about like you know.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Try to find it easy to use, but also secure way to share documents, share files.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:53.000
That's as far as from our group. And I mean, do you have anything like to add on?

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Yeah, so that first bullet point under the what are the needs?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:20.000
That was in reference to an experience that said you had, and she was a tutor for a student who spoke a language that she didn't speak, and so she needed to find a way to translate what she was saying into the language that the student needed or understood and then once that happened the student could

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000
not read it on Google classroom, or on Google classroom Google. Translate.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:44.000
And so the need. There was to have a software that not only translated written word, but like into other written word in another language, but also to translate it into spoken word, so that if a student is too young to read or cannot read, yet regardless of age that way, that tool becomes useful because it became

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000
like, not useful. And she realized the student couldn't read it.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:58.000
So that was the context behind that point. Other than that, I think he did a great job, and like compiling our information.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Cool thanks.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Okay. Questions from the rest of you, Linda Steven, Adam Dalton.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Do any of these? Would you consider them emerging like, for example, the docusign for file, transferring Danny?

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:30.000
That's this, is your world, really. Would you consider this emerging any emerging technology at our campus? Still?

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Yeah.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I think our on campus a lot of the promises are have been using docusign and very widely.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:48.000
But you know there are some things like our office we're still trying to look into it to see whether for like, it's really a good fit for some of the documents transferring, because from time to time really relies on emails ending as a stay there was a time period that

00:59:48.000 --> 01:00:01.000
we had a lot of phishing emails, and we have seen like, there're phishing emails that's basically copy symbols or like images from like emails.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Yeah.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:05.000
We might have seen, for of just frequently, and they just replace the links to make them into like phishing links.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Uhhuh.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So that's gonna be that's kinda secure issues from our perspective.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yeah, it's. This is a very interesting thing.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:21.000
This is a huge educational system we have here right? San Francisco State administratively, quite complex and also relatively decentralized in some ways.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:27.000
For example, the use of docusign docusign's been on campus for quite a number of years.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Now a trickle to start, and more and more I see more and more phones, but I still know there are a lot of forms out there that are not being used with docusign docusign as a service and as a company, as a software platform has been around for I don't know how

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:59.000
long, but I'd have to say at least a decade, and probably longer, and the fact that it's still emerging in some of the units here on San Francisco State says a lot about I think it says a lot more about the way we govern it on our campus than it does about

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:04.000
the quality of the docusign product that may be an editorial comment.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.000
But yeah, that if you, if you don't use it as a unit, you don't know how to put forms into it.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000
You don't know what the, what, what the strengths are, and what the caveats are, what the cautions are for.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Using it so it would still be emerging. How about this Google translate?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:28.000
You know the with the spoken in particular. I've just been exploring with that myself. I'm pretty impressed in general.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Yeah, I feel like, that's at least in my world like, that's definitely something that's emerging.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Cause I like early for me, like I went to Spain last year, and I don't know span like I can understand way more than I can like.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Say. But once I realize that that was a potential like that was like game changer on our trip, like I was able to communicate with more people and just like make more connections and able to like not feel like super dumb thank you. Very help.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Yeah, well, you can ask more complex things, to. You know, everything doesn't have to be in like, you know, a first year Spanish of high school kind of language, which is really pretty simple.

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Yeah, there have been apps around for a while that you could do this.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:25.000
You could train even for your own voice. These I don't know, I don't remember exactly what they were not Google translate, but they were other apps.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000
You could pay for. And you could basically have it do that kind of translation for you, and actually be a you know, it could listen to your voice and speak it out in another language.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And that kind of thing. I never bought it because I didn't really have a specific need for it.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:48.000
So I imagine the technology is just gotten better, especially with the advancements in that artificial intelligence kinda of engines to support this.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
But I've been impressed in my little dabbling with it just in the last.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Oh, last couple of months or so, so I would say, certainly emerging still in many ways, especially in education, I mean, we don't.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
We don't really teach a lot with foreign languages in regular classes.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:13.000
And most of our schools in this country. In most schools, at least, individual, like private schools can do, could do what they want.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
But, like the public school system, I think pretty much. Every State is, unless it's a special specific class.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000
It's pretty much English. Only instruction, I think, isn't it? Even in California?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Did. He has a couple of.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So what happens when these translators become so popular that kids can actually get away with not learning English, at least not early learning English like, we're expecting them to.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:41.000
What would that happen? Would they be able to learn better?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Would would it? You know? Kind of doom our democracy?

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So you imagine the the political number around stuff like this we're just talking about AI.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
But what about AI? Where the language doesn't have to be shared?

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Okay, what does that do? The cultural aspects? Well, maybe people keep march of their own culture.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Maybe they don't assimilate in culture as much, and I don't know consequences for all of them.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
So!

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000
We're not really here to kinda debate the values that. But I do think that some of these technologies have potentially significant impacts.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:24.000
And education is would just be part of like this big thing going on, you know, in our, in our systems.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Yeah, think about that for a moment. Alright, thank you. Anything else. From group One.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Saadia anything to add?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:38.000
No, I think Amanda said what I was talking about.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I worked with a Afghani family, and the They.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
They were pushed through speaking, and I don't understand.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Push 2, so it was very difficult situation for me to like.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Help her communicate in English. So yeah, I was talking about that like how to help students.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Right.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Oh! And she was not able to read or write to.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000
So, yeah.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yeah.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:14.000
It could be very useful. Okay, let's go on to group 2. Adam Dalton.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Yeah, Adam, do you go first, you know, adding the teacher, perspective.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Yeah, sure. So when we were talking about tools using, I was thinking specifically about the context, that you were saying, Doctor B.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:40.000
About, accessing, pre-existing content in the the best one that I was thinking of was for health science programs that I work with bio-digital is a big one, or something also like zygote body, which is what dog brought up so like 3D images of the human body

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000
that make you know that reduce the need to have go to the dissection lab.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:54.000
If on your campus, that you can actually get a really good understanding of human anatomy by by the advances in 3D. Body, imaging.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And then we can hide different parts of the body. You can view different pathologies through through this, through 3 bodies, is pretty cool.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:13.000
So that was something that was building. What you had said. That was one of the ideas I had come up with, that I've been using before.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And then, Dalton, you you had something similar, right?

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure if many of technologies are using.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Now in teaching would be considered, emerging, but at the end of the day I'm the person that vets it.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:33.000
I am the person that that looks searches for it, and then post it.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:43.000
So, yeah, this page is where I've collected the best simulations and videos and articles for my students, based on the product that we do.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
So right now we're about to start electromagnetism.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
We've we're a few weeks into it now.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
And this is kind of like a link, farm type, thing.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I? You know I don't think it's great, but it's a place where I can park a lot of content for myself and also for students.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
So if there's like, if we're learning about magnetism, we can click on this fare fluid link.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Oh! And by the way, I would access this with my paid Google premium accounts, so that the students wouldn't get distracted by the AD.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Of course. And then, yeah. And so I, I put links in there with simulations and videos and articles.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And so also it's a place where it also allows for differentiation.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Right. So for students who are more advanced, who do want something a little spicier.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's in there if they wanted to.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Do something self-paced and a lot of, you know pretty much everything is on me.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I'm the one that's finding the links.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I'm the one that's repairing the links.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Hmm!

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
If I'm the one that's repairing the links, if they're broken or if they're no longer supported and I'm the one that's aggregating things.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:57.000
So. But you know I do realize that putting them all into a Google Doc is not super fancy or flashy, but it gets a job done for myself and students, and there's no login required.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Right. There's no nothing. So it's just a Google Doc that's visible.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000
That's true.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Bye anybody with the link. So you know again he gets the job done, not super sleek, but it is what it is.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Well, you know, 30 years ago I was a physics teacher, and I had.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:25.000
I was the first one to put websites up at our school, and one of my first sights I built was basically a physics website for for my glass.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:31.000
So the fact that you're just using, you know, a web page essentially to add links.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Certainly not emerging. I don't think it is.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
You know the specific things that you're finding here, or your students are really helpful for them.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000
Yeah, is it emerging? I don't know. Maybe it's not.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:56.000
But maybe it is because maybe people don't do this anymore you know, we're just a lot of people are, instead of putting all the, you know, a collection of links together.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000
What do we do? We go to Google or Bing, or something like that, and do a search and boom?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:07.000
There's our web page that comes up, and there's all the links we're gonna pick from, you know, typically not curated very well, and not the way we would do it.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Yeah, we go. Oh, yeah, that one I like, and get out of that.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I think this is cool stuff, of course. Having taught some of this myself, and there's a lot I mean the animations and the kinds of things you can find these days are just a pretty fascinating emerging.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:32.000
I don't know, for some of us, probably. Yes, I haven't really thought about that, you know, using things like that.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.000
And for others who are kind of in the field where the stuff has been around for a while.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Well, not not emerging. I've never built it, but I have used it with students I mean, to see it kind of the idea of using simulated labs, too.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Lab simulations rather than physical lab environments for science classes and things like that new, not really, but for some of us, yeah, totally new, because we don't redundant before, we never had the resource.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
The body, the 3D. Do you remember when the first kind of a 3D.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Model became available. Through this. The slices, you know, that's quite a while ago, I believe, at least at least in Internet time.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Quite a while ago, and that was pretty fascinating, you know, when that became available for people to actually use, the technology has gotten me the representation.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.000
Just pretty fantastic. Nothing like it was before. So okay.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Oh, yeah, I I could see an emergency technology which will be schools hiring like a consultant or some kind of aggregator.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:42.000
You know, team of people like, Hey, okay, we're going to do a study on the great.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You know the big civilizations in the world like, can you give us a set of simulations?

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.000
VR, fil trips right it. This could be some kind of emergent tech.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
You mean like a librarian?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Well, a librarian may not be an expert on the latest VR.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:58.000
That may. Yeah, that's no doubt, no doubt.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I can tell you that from experience do you know what I mean?

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Something like somebody who's scouring the Internet for free, for free super.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it. Got it? Got it? Okay? Like a librarian's helper.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Well!

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Who's you know, contract library, and do those kinds of projects for for him or her?

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. The intern. Yeah.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Yeah.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:26.000
But that does bring up a good point, because, Dr. B. The way you set this set up the question when I was thinking about like existing like accessing like existing like pre-generated content.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Yeah, right?

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I was thinking the first thing I was like, oh, so like, is that like going to the library's website, where you would have that access?

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:52.000
And we were just thinking about the ways that it can be hard for teachers to, and or any subject matter expert to be that subject matter, expert.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Yeah.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
But then, like all that, knowledge is still like a huge barrier for them, because they it's really exciting to get that, whether that might be a textbook or what they can't just like, take their take their students word for it like this this is what I know

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000
Yeah.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
that becomes a huge barrier.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:05.000
What are the well? Obviously, what are the biggest problems we have with the wealth of information we have available is inexing and finding what we need when we need it.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
It's kind of like a memory, right? Your memory is incredibly tuned to do that.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:24.000
But when your memory starts changing right, and maybe when you get a little older, that becomes, that's what people really struggle with is indexing and getting queuing and finding that you know you know something.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But you can't get to it that's that's the frustration.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
I think that a lot of a lot of people have, with the wealth of information we have available.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:41.000
We know there's some information out there, but I don't I don't know how to get to it, and just doing Google searches is a really, that's a really blunt tool, you know.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Maybe the chat, chat gpt stuff will be helpful for that, but we've seen that.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Maybe maybe not, you know, based on what the data we've been or the results will be getting so far. But yeah, if we could get that answer.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
That would be wonderful access to information right when you need it at the right time is just.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:10.000
It's golden, right? Anything else in here. Let's see the vetting.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Someone else has done that don't know who, probably not being done, maybe not being done.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Who knows?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
We also talked about like, who is the burden? Who is burdened?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Is it to vet because it can be huge, huge burden on teachers, but they are the front lines and the ones you reallyre really using it.

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Typically then, like the people further away are the one further away from students, are often vetting it.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:42.000
But then you're just as a teacher. You're just given something that you might not actually be very useful.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Yeah, well, I yeah, what? I don't know what the law says.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:14:00.000
However, I would think that whoever's making the choice to adopt and use something probably has frontline culprit build, or I guess a accountability for doing that or making sure it's been done by someone else.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:06.000
When teachers have a choice to use technologies or not, they're making that choice and so that's a volitional choice.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:16.000
And if they're if that, it's putting students at risk, and if there's some sort of harm done, then you would think that the you know that would be one place where where someone could be held accountable.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000
But you made that choice, didn't know if it was safe for students.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Well, that's bad on you. You should have done that.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Someone should have made sure you knew that was important in the administrator.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The schools probably is. Well, we got this, you know.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:41.000
This blah blah blah thing that's signed by the teachers saying, Yeah, we've gone through this training, and we understand that, you know, you know, data, security, privacy and all that.

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And yet there is some. I'm sure. There are some umbrella liability policy for teachers in general which makes it a school and our school system responsibility, and then they would be the ones be held accountable, and that would probably be where it would go anyway, means teachers would have to be I think

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:04.000
pretty far out of the lines from what the school expectations would be for them to be completely exposed in in our institution.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Higher, add typically what we're concerned with are not about individual harms for students or things like that.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It's really about exposing data, right? When someone's using the system.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
And somehow they get access. The system gets they get access to sensitive data or stuff.

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000
That's Pii in some way. Personally identifiable information, and it gets exposed on the Internet.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:35.000
And then there's a per like a per record charge that that typically institutions are held, that they find huge fines, millions of dollars of fine.

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:43.000
So which is why the University has assurance, and the Csu has insurance to pay, basically pay for that.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:53.000
And then those insurance requirements, then start dictating some of our requirements around the systems that we can use is a risk.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
Okay. Didn't mean to go there, but that's that's a consideration.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:03.000
What all of these kinds of technologies, when you're looking at using more and more and more interesting kinds of data.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Yeah, think about biometric data? Hmm, there's a big bucket with that.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Let's go on a group 3.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000
I'm Linda. I'll go ahead.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:20.000
We both are in careers, where I don't think there's much that we're doing.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:32.000
That's really so for for my students, they're doing some things this year.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:46.000
For the first time. But that's not really emerging to have their own laptops, and my students are using a tool pretty frequently that not a lot of other teachers have adopted, and you could maybe make an argument.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:57.000
That's emerging. The tool that we're using happens to be sanctioned by Ida. It department.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
In other words, they've reviewed it.

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
They've they've accepted it.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.000
And in order for students to use it, they do have to sign in, but they sign in using their school accounts.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:22.000
They can't sign in, not without using this cool account, and it reminds me of like back in the day where people were being zoom bombed because people could just join anonymously.

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And so there is a safety and privacy to an anonymity.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:41.000
But there's also a liability. And when I, when my students sign in to the app that I'm using, I can then collect data that's useful to me.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Which I can't do if it's anonymous, I mean, I can kind of like with Mentor, you know.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
You can get a sense of where the class is at.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:55.000
Yeah.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But I you know I wouldn't know who specifically to help Linda.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:03.000
Has oh, like me, we're not using anything that's particularly emerging.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:29.000
But when he's using tools through the software that she has, that's really useful for finding potential employees.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.000
How are you?

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
And she also has a program that makes basically a Mooc. If if I understand this correctly, please correct me if I'm wrong, Linda, but it's based it.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:47.000
So this, this program takes information from a co-worker, and Linda creates like a training program and.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Oh, please! Please!

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Oh, yeah, similar. I'm sorry. I don't mean to cut you out, Steven. Yeah, we're always here. We were kind of talking about right?

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:59.000
3 60 products. So it's basically like a software tool to where our instructional designer so far, I'm sorry.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
It's a software where you can make your e-learning courses.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.000
Basically just simply put in the way. So what I told Steven was I, you know.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Sometimes I work with a contractors as a freelancing that they will give me their existing Powerpoint formatted training courses, and then to tell me to put this in turn, this into rice course, and then so I basically, kind of copy a piece of content and but make it look

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:39.000
prettier, no way, so a lot of the like learning courses are done via rice, or maybe arise 3, 60, or any other course, U.S.A. or Coursera ones are one like that, too.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
So that's the one I think I mean, I guess instructional technologies standpoint.

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It rise? 3, 6. Is not that emerging? But it's been around for a bit, and then a lot of people are using it.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:01.000
But to me, who, as a somebody who's kind of grating into that field, I thought it was very brilliant tool for me to start learning and using it.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And then to that point. Steven, you were saying that, having a one on like each student having la laptop, is not that emerging?

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000
But to me, as somebody who graduated high school in 2,007, that's pretty damn emerging.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So I thought I it's like I think it was kind of perceive thing, too.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
So in that group classroom thing. So I thought that was pretty cool to learn how.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Now they students get to use technologies to learn, and everything.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
So, yeah.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Okay. Yeah. Rise, 3, 60 is been around for a while, and the functionality of the E-learning development software has been out.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:42.000
For you know, quite a quite a long time. I remember the days when we had to. Everything was done by hand, and this is so much better you can do so much more.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.000
But you are also. You also look kind of limited to the rise.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.000
3, 60, the limits on their creativity, and what they'll what they'll support.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I thought it was interesting. That you compared it to a Mooc, because the people who work for mood companies right would probably say Moocs are different than e-learning.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And yet when I first heard about Moocs, and I think 2,007 or so, I thought, Isn't this isn't this e-learning where it's both mostly, you know, not very interactive?

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:15.000
That's not really facilitated. It's great information to some in Internet activity. Perhaps.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Or it may be discussions, maybe not just great, really great content.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And then, and then, but it was mostly what I would call independent self paced kinda learning environments.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
So I know they've changed somewhat in some ways.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:41.000
And become a lot more specific. So anyway, I thought that was, I just had to smile when I heard that.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Yup, that's what we basically kind of talked about.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:52.000
And we kind of also kind of talked about what in these areas, and perhaps even did point it out like the security things that they have to go through.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And then there's some pro programs not being available for all.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Cross. My issue was, or for Linkedin I just put better work, feel keyword function applied Linkedin recruiter is, if you don't know Linkedin recruiter is of our tool.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
That recruiters use. Only you have to pay for it.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:26.000
If it allows us to kind of go around and search people by using keywords, and we allows us to look at each people's profile without notifying the person that we're looking at.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000
It so, but it could use a lot more work on in terms of better keyword filtering.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
So that's like a that's we pay a lot of money for it.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Sure!

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:42.000
But I'm like, this is very basic. So and then rise 3 62.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.000
It's great, but like it doesn't give you a whole lot of freedom to be very creative to.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:52.000
It. It has limitation on certain functions. Are you? You're on mute, Dr.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
Weedy.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000
So you're still on mute.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
There you go!

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:06.000
Okay. Thank you. That's why you kept talking.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000
When I was when I was talking to talk over you, Linkedin.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Learning, I think, is a good example of a system that we most of us use for free Nope.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Most of us don't pay for that, or some, you know.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:22.000
At least most of the people I know that I have talked to don't pay for anything in the advanced services, and yet we're providing the data that Linkedin then gets to sell to others.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Basically to recruiters in this. In this sense, since there's probably other ways, they're monetizing this.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
And so we're kind of paying with our data.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
We're giving them we're giving them a valuable resources, and they can do that.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000
And everybody knows that, and actually a lot of people on Linkedin.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:48.000
They don't mind, because maybe everyone down there is sort of always looking for a job, you know.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Is there something better out there? You know that kind of thing?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:56.000
So yet I bet no one's ever read that in the document.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Yeah, probably not. I think Linkedin is a platform for people to be discovered.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So, even if they don't know they're be like, oh, we're go!

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I'm here for a price.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Yeah, that's right. It's it's a networking environment.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Yeah.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And you know your network, because you know, part of it's to to share and to take advantage of opportunities.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Absolutely.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:25.000
So alright. Thank you. Any comments or other questions or comments from some of anyone else on this.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:31.000
I was just thinking when we think about like the prompt on like accessing content.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:53.000
And that's what we're talking about. I one of the things that I think is still kind of a need is that like, you know, a lot of the links you provided here around like different, like, you know, like 3D interactive multimedia models like virtual field trips there's sometimes it's hard to

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Yeah.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:04.000
make as an instructor to make that active learning, like students might just like click around and do something, or you like, give them some prompts and some sometimes those prompts are more just like, did you find the thing?

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000
Right.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000
And it almost becomes like a scavenger hunt, so like, how do you make those content accessing tools really like a an active learning experience?

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Or students are like getting to higher levels of thinking.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:17.000
It's good question. Do you remember, have you ever heard of the concept of a web quest?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Request. Oh, my gosh! I'm that old right!

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Maybe.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000
I remember when webcams were like the latest, greatest new thing.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:33.000
It was a way to actually make the Internet useful for students to use on their own time, to do something for a class, a class activity, or a homework assignment.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:38.000
And basically it was go to this site, find this information out, you know, you know.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Blah blah blah! Do send me where that maybe write some.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
You know what what I mean. I don't know what you would do, meaning for find this.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:51.000
Go to another site. Do this. There, and then. That's this part of the little project doing then go to this other side.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:26:07.000
So you might go through a series of projects kind of touring them through the web to create this, to finish this quest, and maybe the quest is to come up with an an exponential of why something happened, or an understanding of some historical thing. Or what it might be.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.000
But there was. It was a big thing. As a matter of fact, Bernie Dodge is San Diego State made a career out of this for, like 20 years, he wrote.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:17.000
A. I think he wrote a book on, and everything it's called a Web Quest.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:29.000
If you've never, never explored a web quest, or if you if that was something you've heard about in the ancient history of the web, you haven't explored, you might take a look at that, because that that was that's what comes to mind with some of these sites.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:32.000
Yeah, you wouldn't just send them to the said, Oh, just go play around unless that's all you really wanted them to do.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:38.000
What are the possibilities like? Say, you're gonna go somewhere with them like to a museum?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Maybe a local museum and they have a virtual tour available well, here's a link.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:56.000
You know your assignment for tonight is to go home and explore this for 20 or 30 min and to find 3 things that you want to see when we actually go there, or something like that, to give them the but the point is that you can do that kind of thing at these web.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:07.000
At the site. And so this is where you this is the instructional preparation here's the link you access this information, and here's what you do with it, and then you go here and then you do this with that.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Those kinds of things that would be. That would be the thing to do rather than I tend to give you a lot of links and things, because I know that you know, do you guys typically know how to explore?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:29.000
You know what you're looking for, kids? Not so much. Necessarily, you know. If they are being, if they have to go somewhere, they may just go there and not know what to do unless you tell them what to do.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
So that might be an approach I was. I've been.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.000
I was just looking for my chat window to, so I could spell web quest for you. W.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000
Eb, q-ust, boom. It probably used to have a website, too. I don't know if it still does.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Webquest.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000
Yeah, I I think Bernie Dons just now retired, his hair is wider than mine.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:28:01.000
So okay, well, thank you for the conversation. And that was really interesting for those of you who are watching online in the recording, you will find that there is a group for.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And this is going to be for our asynchronous learners.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:12.000
You can all be part of the same big group. And so you can add your notes to this.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
This little group for and make sure you add your names as well.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:23.000
I'm gonna actually say, add your names. So if you get to this part of the recording or the transcript, I'll speak very clearly for the transcript.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Please go to the shared boot breakout notes, page, and add your contribution to it.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:35.000
Group, for alright, now for the rest of us, as we wrap up real quickly.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:48.000
What are we gonna be doing? The discussion Forum actually change the prompt a little bit to focus more on, think technologies that we would consider emerging or emerging ish right?

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000
So think about the technologies that you are using now that are new to you, or what you would consider.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
You know, I'm just kind of. I'm still learning how to do this to me.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
That's still kind of fits within our big envelope.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Inside the big tent of emerging technologies. But if you don't have any technologies like that, like I heard from some of you tonight not really doing anything new new technologies.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I'm pretty comfortable with what I'm using.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Then think about the next technology. You might want to explore and take this as an opportunity to start dabbling around with that, because in 2 weeks I think it's in 2 weeks you get a chance to talk about in a a technology that is what you would consider emerging for you and how you might apply

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:33.000
it with your students. Okay? So you can start that. Now with this discussion, this is about content.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Once again accessing content. That's not really creating content.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Next week we'll take a similar approach, and we'll talk about content creation.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
You having students create content students, as you know, Prosumers.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
You may have heard that term before, where they're producing content as well as perhaps consuming content.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:57.000
Oftentimes, when students create content they're we're actually asking them to create content.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So that other students can learn from what they're creating.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
That's what we do in this class all the time.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
Hope you recognize that that's where we're going.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
That's what we're talking about next week.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Are there any questions?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:20.000
Okay. I waited my 5 s. I don't hear any questions, so I'm gonna pause. Them.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:23.000
So I'm gonna stop the recording and I'll see you online in the Forum.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:31.000
And also
